<h1>8-2 SF Drag</h1>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | Last updated 2021-October-02</em></center>

<p>
	There are two possible spawns you'll need to tank when dragging 8-2 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Okm6QEhlpRU">example setup by Triscuiticus</a>): id1252 (Rippers and Prowlers) and id1253 (Vespids).
	The Vespids are rather damaging with 39 FP, so you'll need armor on your tank.
	Luckily, as you're on an allied node and have lots of SF around, Defend and Weaken can make this much easier.
</p>

<p>
	Following are the armor requirements to reduce even the highest damage rolls from these Vespids to 1:
</p>

<center>
	<table style="width:75%">
	  <tr>
		<th># of Weaken chips</th>
		<th>Armor req (base)</th>
		<th>Armor req (Defend)</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>44</td>
		<td>30</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>39</td>
		<td>26</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>34</td>
		<td>23</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>30</td>
		<td>20</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</center>

<p>
	You may be able to get by with slightly less armor, but these are the ideal thresholds for minimizing repairs.
	With strong support and a good tank, it's possible to go all 99 turns without repairing.
	Even aside from the armor bonus, bringing a ringleader with Defend is strongly recommended for the increase in survivability its evasion buff brings.
	It can, depending on exact stats, approximately double your tank's lifespan.
</p>

<p>
	You'll also need something in the top row that can handle a few Prowlers.
	They only have 10 FP, so pretty much anything armored is fine there.
</p>

<p>
	Manticores are the longest-lasting tank, but their high cost limits what else you can bring.
	The stats on an Aegis are only slightly lower, so they may be preferable.
	Depending on your level of desperation, Nemeums/Tarantulas may work with some extra repair trips.
</p>

<p>
	(The pre-spawned Strikers can also be fairly damaging due to their high ROF. I recommend trying to kill those with your clearing team whenever convenient.)
</p>

	(As with pretty much everything in this game, Weaken chips stack multiplicatively.)
