	<h1>8-2 SF Drag</h1>

<h2>Armor Requirements<sup><small><a href="#armor">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>
	There are two possible spawns you'll need to tank when dragging 8-2 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Okm6QEhlpRU">example setup by Triscuiticus</a>): id1252 (Rippers and Prowlers) and id1253 (Vespids).
	The Vespids are rather damaging with 39 FP, so you'll need armor on your tank.
	Luckily, as you're on an allied node and have lots of SF around, Defend and Weaken can make this much easier.
</p>

<p>
	Following are the armor requirements to reduce even the highest damage rolls from these Vespids to 1:
</p>

<center>
	<table style="width:75%">
	  <tr>
		<th># of Weaken chips</th>
		<th>Armor req (base)</th>
		<th>Armor req (Defend)</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>44</td>
		<td>30</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>39</td>
		<td>26</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>34</td>
		<td>23</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>30</td>
		<td>20</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</center>

<p>
	You may be able to get by with slightly less armor, but these are the ideal thresholds for minimizing repairs.
	With strong support and a good tank, it's possible to go all 99 turns without repairing.
	Even aside from the armor bonus, bringing a ringleader with Defend is strongly recommended for the increase in survivability its evasion buff brings.
	It can, depending on exact stats, approximately double your tank's lifespan.
</p>

<p>
	You'll also need something in the top row that can handle a few Prowlers.
	They only have 10 FP, so pretty much anything armored is fine there.
	If you don't mind a marginally higher repair bill, it's even possible to use something like a decently-leveled Scout.
</p>

<p>
	Manticores are the longest-lasting tank, but their high cost limits what else you can bring.
	The stats on an Aegis are only slightly lower, so they may be preferable.
	Depending on your level of desperation, Nemeums/Tarantulas may work with some extra repair trips.
</p>

<p>
	(The pre-spawned Strikers can also be fairly damaging due to their high ROF. I recommend killing those with your clearing team whenever convenient.)
</p>
<!-- <p>
	(As with pretty much everything in this game, Weaken chips stack multiplicatively.)
</p> -->

<span class="anchor" id="architect"></span>
<h2>HOC Options<sup><small><a href="#architect">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	When Destroyer was released, she was the only HOC support available.
	Not much you can do but use two of her.
	We get a few more options with Architect's release: you can go with double Destroyers, one Destroyer and one Architect support, or double Architects.
	Here's a few tests comparing them, going by the estimated total number of attacks taken.
</p>

<center>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/8-2/sfhoccharts.png" width="80%"/>
</div>
</center>
<p>
	Turns out that Destroyer's not very good at this - you definitely want at least one Architect, and two of her may even be better than a mix.
</p>
<p>
	All tests were done with 2x Weaken, 3x Fighting Spirit, 1x Defend, 99 turns. No repairs needed.
	I like this metric a bit better than measuring damage taken, as it's comparable across different tanks and different evasion levels.
	The length of each 8-2 run means the sample sizes are pretty small, but hopefully it's convincing enough anyways.
	Measuring something like time is extremely bothersome to keep fair, and the in-game damage chart is <a href="myths#dmgchart">a bit unreliable</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Dreamer is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zUxZ8uL.png">absolutely terrible</a> as support.
	Her data isn't included in the plot above as I don't plan on going through the suffering needed to make her boxes properly representative.
</p>

<!-- Minimizing run time could be another thing, but I'm not going to intensely babysit the game for that long in order to make it a good comparison -->
