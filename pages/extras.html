        <p>Missed some login dolls way back when the game launched?
        Heard Super SASS has a neural upgrade in the future?
        Interested in Type 59 accuracy memes?</p>

        <p>Here're the routes I used to farm all the limited dolls in Arctic Warfare, done in an era where we have Parachute fairies, M4 mod, M1911 mod, and so on.
        I tried to get them as AFK as possible, though feel free to contact me if you know a beter way.</p>

				<p><em>(2020-11-17)</em> Continuum Turbulence is now permanently available!
				Get your Pythons today with this handy double drag.
				It has 4 checks per run, is resource efficient, and is 100% consistent.</p>

				<p>Requirements: 4 strong RFs, 3* statstick fairy, 3 HGs with good tiles. Can grind out levels 90-100 on some of your dolls here too.</p>

        <h2 id="fairycraft">Rare Fairy Crafting Strategies</h2>

        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CSC17pKJ8BDDm9YYNB8pFqT8k0Np_jWDeu_1X-qJ7yI/edit">All on this spreadsheet.</a></p> Switch tabs to view rateup/non-rateup calculations.

        <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> if you want to obtain a Parachute fairy, craft 2000/500/2000/1000 tier 1 or 2 for the best rate. If you need to star up your base fairies, craft lots of 500x4 tier 1.
        This is aimed towards efficiently enhancing the rarity of your parachute or other expensive recipe fairies.</p>

        <p>The colored cells contain different value metrics of each recipe, with dark green being the most efficient in that column and bright yellow least efficient.</p>

        <p>What resource each commander is limited by will vary wildly, so I included several different ways to measure the value of each recipe. Feel free to download/copy the sheet and edit the weightings to your liking.</p>

        <p>Overall, 2/5/2/1 tier 1 or 2 and 500x4 look to be strong options for raising parachute fairies specifically - 500x4 for pure resource efficiency, and the expensive recipe to save on cores/contracts.</p>

        <p>Once you add other expensive fairies into the mix, 2/2/2/1 does quite well. Upping the parts to 2000 barely helps, decreasing overall resource efficiency. 2/5/2/1 also has pretty high numbers, but it doesn't actually help with raising some of the interesting expensive fairies like combo or landmine. Despite its excellent value with raising just one expensive fairy (parachute), 500x4 falls behind on resource efficiency as you try to raise a range of expensive fairies.</p>

        <p>Also of interest: comparing rateup rates to the rates just before, all recipes see a 30-40% increase in total fairy rate. This isn't as good as the 100%+ boost observed in the general doll rateup, but it's certainly not a complete scam and a fair bit higher than the rates described in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/bokege/gfl_crafting_statistics_or_why_sgfairy_rateup_is/">this post from a while back</a>.</p>

        <p>Enhancement costs, shared talents, and standard pool fairy XP are not accounted for here. Future rates may vary.</p>

        <p>Imagine whaling for data. If you do plan on it though, here's how to get your money's worth.</p>

        <p>Batteries and most other extras are not considered here. The net value of each package is converted to effective energy per gem, with higher energy/gem being better.</p>

				<p>Calibration tickets are valued at 52 per 5 energy (going to wave ~107).</p>

				<!-- <h2 id="tpdummy">Target Practice Dummy setting estimates</h2>

				<center><em>Updated 2020-12-23</em></center>

				<div class="figure">
				<img src="images/extra/dummy-eva.png" width="100%"/>
				</div>
				<p>I let a level ~70 m45 (with 10 accuracy) shoot the target practice dummy for 300 seconds a bunch of times with no skill.
				By looking at the total damage dealt, this lets me estimate its evasion at each setting.
				These aren't <em>super</em> precise - I'd place Very High at 200-225 evasion, High at 100-120, Medium at 30-40, and Low is likely 15.
				To provide some verification of this method, running the same experiment with no evasion estimated its evasion at -0.14, pretty close to the expected 0.</p>

				<p>Generally, if enemy armor exceeds your armor piercing and you have 100% crit rate,</p>
				<div class="figure">
				<img src="images/extra/math.png" width="100%"/>
				</div>
				<p>We can use this to estimate the armor given by each setting of the dummy:</p>
				<div class="figure">
				<img src="images/extra/dummy-armor.png" width="100%"/>
				</div>
				<p>Here, I instead let a M14/Desert Eagle shoot the dummy 25-50 times and looked at the total damage dealt.
					M14 only needed 5-7 to cap on crit rate (she got retreated immediately), while Desert Eagle also had a Crit II Fury Fairy.
				To help with estimating lower armor values, Deagle used minimally calibrated HP ammo with -10 AP.</p>

				<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I'm not aware of any currently known/datamined values for these settings. If there are, please let me know and I'll update this with the true values.</p> -->

				<h2 id="smgcharts">Additional SMG equipment charts</h2>

				<p>See <a href="shrimp-equip.html">Shrimp's</a> and <a href="x95.html">X95's</a> articles for reference on what this is all about.

				<center><em>JS 9's chart.</em></center>

				<p>Note that, because JS 9 sits right above a frame breakpoint, ITIs slow her down and perform much worse on her.
				The impact of this will lessen if she has ROF buffs that move her away from a breakpoint: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3X6R8zE.png">for example, here's her chart with just +1 base ROF across the board</a>.

				<center><em>Honey Badger's chart.</em></center>

				<p>ARs/RFs don't need the same type of chart as they have much higher base accuracy - you just always use crit scopes.
