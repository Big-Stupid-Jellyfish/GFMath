<p>Missed some login dolls way back when the game launched?
Heard Super SASS has a neural upgrade in the future?
Interested in Type 59 accuracy memes?</p>

<p>Here're the routes I used to farm all the limited dolls in Arctic Warfare, done in an era where we have Parachute fairies, M4 mod, M1911 mod, and so on.
I tried to get them as AFK as possible, though feel free to contact me if you know a beter way.</p>

<center><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brgGuO0lJ38" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p><em>(2021-01-06)</em> And here are my routes for Cube. E1-3 is almost entirely auto, while E1-4 is almost entirely manual. E1-2 is somewhat farmable, but E1-3 has more dolls available, can get more checks, and is more auto-friendly.</p>

<p><em>(2020-11-17)</em> Continuum Turbulence is now permanently available!
Get your Pythons today with this handy double drag.
It has 4 checks per run, is resource efficient, and is 100% consistent.</p>

<p>Requirements: 4 strong RFs, 3* statstick fairy, 3 HGs with good tiles. Can grind out levels 90-100 on some of your dolls here too.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="fairycraft"></span>
<h2>Rare Fairy Crafting Strategies<sup><small><a href="#fairycraft">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CSC17pKJ8BDDm9YYNB8pFqT8k0Np_jWDeu_1X-qJ7yI/edit">All on this spreadsheet.</a></p> Switch tabs to view rateup/non-rateup calculations.

<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> if you want to obtain a Parachute fairy, craft 2000/500/2000/1000 tier 1 or 2 for the best rate. If you need to star up your base fairies, craft lots of 500x4 tier 1.
This is aimed towards efficiently enhancing the rarity of your parachute or other expensive recipe fairies.</p>

<p>The colored cells contain different value metrics of each recipe, with dark green being the most efficient in that column and bright yellow least efficient.</p>

<p>What resource each commander is limited by will vary wildly, so I included several different ways to measure the value of each recipe. Feel free to download/copy the sheet and edit the weightings to your liking.</p>

<p>Overall, 2/5/2/1 tier 1 or 2 and 500x4 look to be strong options for raising parachute fairies specifically - 500x4 for pure resource efficiency, and the expensive recipe to save on cores/contracts.</p>

<p>Once you add other expensive fairies into the mix, 2/2/2/1 does quite well. Upping the parts to 2000 barely helps, decreasing overall resource efficiency. 2/5/2/1 also has pretty high numbers, but it doesn't actually help with raising some of the interesting expensive fairies like combo or landmine. Despite its excellent value with raising just one expensive fairy (parachute), 500x4 falls behind on resource efficiency as you try to raise a range of expensive fairies.</p>

<p>Also of interest: comparing rateup rates to the rates just before, all recipes see a 30-40% increase in total fairy rate. This isn't as good as the 100%+ boost observed in the general doll rateup, but it's certainly not a complete scam and a fair bit higher than the rates described in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/bokege/gfl_crafting_statistics_or_why_sgfairy_rateup_is/">this post from a while back</a>.</p>

<p>Enhancement costs, shared talents, and standard pool fairy XP are not accounted for here. Future rates may vary.</p>

<h2>Target Practice Dummy Effective HP<sup><small><a href="#dummyehp">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/misc/OOVLEck.png" width="579px"/>
</div>

<p>Setting different levels of force field let you effectively get different amounts of HP compared to the Strength 1-5 settings. Here's all those combinations. See <a href="dummy">this article</a> for more on the target practice dummy.
It should go without saying, but the forcefield settings don't work for this purpose if you use HOCs.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="cecorrel"></span>
<h2>Stage CE/EXP cap correlation<sup><small><a href="#cecorrel">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/misc/V257ZX9.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>While the level caps and CE ratings of a stage have no inherent need to relate, there is a strong positive correlation between them.
Once you get past ~17000 CE, all stages recorded have caps above level 100.
To go all the way up to level 120, you'll want to start looking at 25000+ CE maps (or just grind 12-4E).</p>

<p>Level penalty numbers taken from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/j1v3lw/weekly_commanders_lounge_september_29_2020/g7lc44o/">/u/UnironicWeeabo's autobattle chart</a>.
This includes campaign stages up to Singularity.
Why do some levels have caps above 120? We may never know.</p>

<center><em>JS 9's chart.</em></center>

<p>Note that, because JS 9 sits right above a frame breakpoint, ITIs slow her down and perform much worse on her.
The impact of this will lessen if she has ROF buffs that move her away from a breakpoint: <a href="images/misc/3X6R8zE.png">for example, here's her chart with just +1 base ROF across the board</a>.

<p>ARs/RFs don't need the same type of chart as they have much higher base accuracy - you just always use crit scopes.

<span class="anchor" id="sgcrafting"></span>
<h2>Crafting Shotguns<sup><small><a href="#sgcrafting">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>Due to the extremely high cost of crafting and niche uses, shotguns are a popular pick for each major event's True Core mask.
These aren't always available and don't work on 3 or 4-star dolls, so you may still want to do some heavy doll production.
I recommend avoiding it as much as possible, but here are some things to consider when picking your recipe.</p>

<p>Question 1: is 6/1/6/4 or 8/1/8/4 better? Let's look at some <a href="https://gf-db.github.io/gfdb/gfdb.html?type=tdoll_recipe&mp=6000&ammo=1000&mre=6000&part=4000&tier=1&epoch.tdoll=83.3&sort.tdoll_recipe=[{%22sort_column%22:%22class%22,%22dir%22:1},{%22sort_column%22:%22*%22,%22dir%22:1}]">recent data</a> (taken before LTLX batch) and compare:</p>
<center>
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<th>Recipe</th>
<th>5* SG rate</th>
<th>4* SG rate</th>
<th>3* SG rate</th>
<th>Total SG rate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8/1/8/4 T1</td>
<td>9.84%</td>
<td>24.36%</td>
<td>17.17%</td>
<td>51.33%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6/1/6/4 T1</td>
<td>6.68%</td>
<td>16.35%</td>
<td>12.04%</td>
<td>35.07%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>8/1/8/4 has higher rates across the board, but we also have to factor in its increased cost - valuing parts 3x other resources, it has a total weighted resource cost of 29000 vs 6/1/6/4's 25000.
Let's divide the above table by those costs to find the effective number of shotguns per 1M resources spent:</p>
<center>
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<th>Recipe</th>
<th>5* SGs/1M rsc</th>
<th>4* SGs/1M rsc</th>
<th>3* SGs/1M rsc</th>
<th>Total SGs/1M rsc</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8/1/8/4 T1</td>
<td>3.39</td>
<td>8.40</td>
<td>5.91</td>
<td>17.70</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6/1/6/4 T1</td>
<td>2.67</td>
<td>6.54</td>
<td>4.82</td>
<td>14.03</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>So 8/1/8/4 is more resource-efficient no matter what rarity of shotgun you're going for.</p>

<p>Now that we know the recipe to use, let's see if increasing the tier is worth it (<a href="https://gf-db.github.io/gfdb/gfdb.html?type=tdoll_recipe&mp=8000&ammo=1000&mre=8000&part=4000&tier=1&epoch.tdoll=74.1&sort.tdoll_recipe=[{%22sort_column%22:%22class%22,%22dir%22:1},{%22sort_column%22:%22*%22,%22dir%22:1}]">data source</a>).</p>
<center>
<table style="width:80%">
<tr>
<th>Tier</th>
<th>5* SG rate</th>
<th>4* SG rate</th>
<th>3* SG rate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>9.72%</td>
<td>24.68%</td>
<td>16.88%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>12.31%<sup>+26%</sup></td>
<td>29.98%<sup>+21%</sup></td>
<td>9.18%<sup>-46%</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>14.87%<sup>+21%</sup></td>
<td>37.54%<sup>+25%</sup></td>
<td>0%<sup>-100%</sup></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>It's much harder to recommend a specific tier here as it will depend on how many resources/contracts/cores you have and which dolls you need.
Higher tiers are bad if you still need a 3* SG, especially at tier 3 where they cannot drop at all.
Otherwise, they offer a potentially worthwhile increase in 4/5* SG rates and older players may have lots of T-Doll contracts to spare for that.
Superscripts are the relative change from the previous tier.</p>

<p>Rates for non-SG dolls are not noted because you should never be doing heavy production for those.</p>

<p>
	It's hard to be that confident with the amount of data I currently have, but I have yet to see evidence suggesting the rates of gold/white talents are substantially different.
	The "expected" bar chart would be the average number of each assuming each talent has exactly the same chance from production, and some variation from that is natural.

<h2>Data sim distances<sup><small><a href="#datasimdistance">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<!-- 2022-06-13 -->
<p>
	Bullets have travel time, so if you want the fastest data times possible you'll want your dolls as close to it as possible.
	If you're wondering exactly how much of a difference it makes, here's the travel times for each position:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/misc/uLfNytg.png" width="100%"/>

<p>
	"Row" and "column" are used interchangeably, and both almost always refer to the thing that goes up and down on your screen (side to side for your dolls).

<p>
	Some observations on equipment calibration:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Generally, each calibration will either keep the overall stat calibration the same (by redistributing), or cause a net stat increase.</li>
	<li>On the sixth calibration, and every ten after, you are guaranteed to get a stat increase.</li>
	<li>There is no hard pity threshold, but as you're likely to get within 1 of the end by the 16th calibration, most equipment will be finished at that point.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	You can check your <code>equip_info.csv</code> file to see indications of this, or try counting as you calibrate.

<h2>P22 vs Px4 in Pink/Python<sup><small><a href="extras#pppp">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>A few quick comparisons, looking at DPS only:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/extra/pppp-hgs.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>Left: Px4 and P22 are almost equal in terms of DPS, if the enemy has very unrealistic amounts of armor. Right: more typical conditions. Charts zoomed in to show detail.</p>

<p>Px4 Storm is <a href="px4">nearly unmatched</a> as a buffer.
In Pink/Python formations, she'll generally outperform P22 even considering the added bonus from Python's reflections and P22's slightly better tiles.
That said, she gives no evasion or shields to your front dolls, so P22 may be preferable depending on what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>M14 used to avoid any tile complications. For example, with R93, you may want to put her on 7 to get her tiles on Px4 Storm.
That starts to add additional variables when she'd go back to 1 (and receive Strawberry's tiles) when P22 is used.
M14 is generally not the best pick here.</p>

<p>A more recent addition that's also worth considering: Webley.</p>

<p>52% ROF from tiles, 28% from Calico's skill, 22% from Webley's skill, and up to 34% from Pink/Python result in a net 218% ROF buff.
A rifle with 38+ ROF will start to lose efficiency from overcap with all skills active.
This doesn't make them immediately unusable, but it's something to consider.
For peace of mind, Rico/Type88/KSVK/IWS all have 37 or less ROF. R93, M14, and Lee Enfield will be at a relative disadvantage.</p> --->
