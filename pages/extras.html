        <p>Missed some login dolls way back when the game launched?
        Heard Super SASS has a neural upgrade in the future?
        Interested in Type 59 accuracy memes?</p>

        <p>Here're the routes I used to farm all the limited dolls in Arctic Warfare, done in an era where we have Parachute fairies, M4 mod, M1911 mod, and so on.
        I tried to get them as AFK as possible, though feel free to contact me if you know a beter way.</p>

				<p><em>(2021-01-06)</em> And here are my routes for Cube. E1-3 is almost entirely auto, while E1-4 is almost entirely manual. E1-2 is somewhat farmable, but E1-3 has more dolls available, can get more checks, and is more auto-friendly.</p>

				<p><em>(2020-11-17)</em> Continuum Turbulence is now permanently available!
				Get your Pythons today with this handy double drag.
				It has 4 checks per run, is resource efficient, and is 100% consistent.</p>

				<p>Requirements: 4 strong RFs, 3* statstick fairy, 3 HGs with good tiles. Can grind out levels 90-100 on some of your dolls here too.</p>

        <h2 id="fairycraft">Rare Fairy Crafting Strategies<sup><small><a href="extras.html#fairycraft">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CSC17pKJ8BDDm9YYNB8pFqT8k0Np_jWDeu_1X-qJ7yI/edit">All on this spreadsheet.</a></p> Switch tabs to view rateup/non-rateup calculations.

        <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> if you want to obtain a Parachute fairy, craft 2000/500/2000/1000 tier 1 or 2 for the best rate. If you need to star up your base fairies, craft lots of 500x4 tier 1.
        This is aimed towards efficiently enhancing the rarity of your parachute or other expensive recipe fairies.</p>

        <p>The colored cells contain different value metrics of each recipe, with dark green being the most efficient in that column and bright yellow least efficient.</p>

        <p>What resource each commander is limited by will vary wildly, so I included several different ways to measure the value of each recipe. Feel free to download/copy the sheet and edit the weightings to your liking.</p>

        <p>Overall, 2/5/2/1 tier 1 or 2 and 500x4 look to be strong options for raising parachute fairies specifically - 500x4 for pure resource efficiency, and the expensive recipe to save on cores/contracts.</p>

        <p>Once you add other expensive fairies into the mix, 2/2/2/1 does quite well. Upping the parts to 2000 barely helps, decreasing overall resource efficiency. 2/5/2/1 also has pretty high numbers, but it doesn't actually help with raising some of the interesting expensive fairies like combo or landmine. Despite its excellent value with raising just one expensive fairy (parachute), 500x4 falls behind on resource efficiency as you try to raise a range of expensive fairies.</p>

        <p>Also of interest: comparing rateup rates to the rates just before, all recipes see a 30-40% increase in total fairy rate. This isn't as good as the 100%+ boost observed in the general doll rateup, but it's certainly not a complete scam and a fair bit higher than the rates described in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/bokege/gfl_crafting_statistics_or_why_sgfairy_rateup_is/">this post from a while back</a>.</p>

        <p>Enhancement costs, shared talents, and standard pool fairy XP are not accounted for here. Future rates may vary.</p>

        <p>Setting different levels of force field let you effectively get different amounts of HP compared to the Strength 1-5 settings. Here's all those combinations. See <a href="dummy.html">this article</a> for more on the target practice dummy.</p>

        <p>Imagine whaling for data. If you do plan on it though, here's how to get your money's worth.</p>

        <p>Batteries and most other extras are not considered here. The net value of each package is converted to effective energy per gem, with higher energy/gem being better.</p>

				<p>Calibration tickets are valued at 52 per 5 energy (going to wave ~107).</p>

				<!-- <p>The Division Supply Package (2021-01) & the White Day Supply Package (2021-03) are a little unusual - they contain 330 gems & 500 advanced data for $4.99 USD.
				Assuming a typical data value of 0.15 energy/gem, this package is equivalent to around 104 gems/$. For comparison: monthly card gets you 225 gems/$, first-time purchase packages are around 130 gems/$, and gem packages after that are around 80 gems/$.
				Possibly worth it if you often buy gems after the first-time bonus and want advanced data, but not worth it otherwise.</p> -->

				<p>There are also some packages available for direct purchase only.
				I'll compare these instead in terms of their Gems per dollar equivalent, assuming the alternative is buying gems -> buying extra energy -> running simulations.
				All prices given in USD, without tax. More gems/$ is better.</p>

				<center><em>JS 9's chart.</em></center>

				<p>Note that, because JS 9 sits right above a frame breakpoint, ITIs slow her down and perform much worse on her.
				The impact of this will lessen if she has ROF buffs that move her away from a breakpoint: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3X6R8zE.png">for example, here's her chart with just +1 base ROF across the board</a>.

				<p>ARs/RFs don't need the same type of chart as they have much higher base accuracy - you just always use crit scopes.
