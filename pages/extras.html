        This page contains random extra things I've made that are too short to go on their own.

        <p>Missed some login dolls way back when the game launched?
        Heard Super SASS has a neural upgrade in the future?
        Interested in Type 59 accuracy memes?</p>

        <p>Here're the routes I used to farm all the limited dolls in Arctic Warfare, done in an era where we have Parachute fairies, M4 mod, M1911 mod, and so on.
        I tried to get them as AFK as possible, though feel free to contact me if you know a beter way.</p>

        <h2 id="fairycraft">Rare Fairy Crafting Strategies</h2>

        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CSC17pKJ8BDDm9YYNB8pFqT8k0Np_jWDeu_1X-qJ7yI/edit">All on this spreadsheet.</a></p> Switch tabs to view rateup/non-rateup calculations.

        <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> if you want to obtain a Parachute fairy, craft 2000/500/2000/1000 tier 1 or 2 for the best rate. If you need to star up your base fairies, craft lots of 500x4 tier 1.
        This is aimed towards efficiently enhancing the rarity of your parachute or other expensive recipe fairies.</p>

        <p>The colored cells contain different value metrics of each recipe, with dark green being the most efficient in that column and bright yellow least efficient.</p>

        <p>What resource each commander is limited by will vary wildly, so I included several different ways to measure the value of each recipe. Feel free to download/copy the sheet and edit the weightings to your liking.</p>

        <p>Overall, 2/5/2/1 tier 1 or 2 and 500x4 look to be strong options for raising parachute fairies specifically - 500x4 for pure resource efficiency, and the expensive recipe to save on cores/contracts.</p>

        <p>Once you add other expensive fairies into the mix, 2/2/2/1 does quite well. Upping the parts to 2000 barely helps, decreasing overall resource efficiency. 2/5/2/1 also has pretty high numbers, but it doesn't actually help with raising some of the interesting expensive fairies like combo or landmine. Despite its excellent value with raising just one expensive fairy (parachute), 500x4 falls behind on resource efficiency as you try to raise a range of expensive fairies.</p>

        <p>Also of interest: comparing rateup rates to the rates just before, all recipes see a 30-40% increase in total fairy rate. This isn't as good as the 100%+ boost observed in the general doll rateup, but it's certainly not a complete scam and a fair bit higher than the rates described in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/bokege/gfl_crafting_statistics_or_why_sgfairy_rateup_is/">this post from a while back</a>.</p>

        <p>Enhancement costs, shared talents, and standard pool fairy XP are not accounted for here. Future rates may vary.</p>

        <p>Setting different levels of force field let you effectively get different amounts of HP compared to the Strength 1-5 settings. Here's all those combinations.</p>

        <p>Batteries and most other extras are not included here at all. Higher energy/gem is better.</p>
