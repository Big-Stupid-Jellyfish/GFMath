<p>Missed some login dolls way back when the game launched?
Heard Super SASS has a neural upgrade in the future?
Interested in Type 59 accuracy memes?</p>

<p>Here're the routes I used to farm all the limited dolls in Arctic Warfare, done in an era where we have Parachute fairies, M4 mod, M1911 mod, and so on.
I tried to get them as AFK as possible, though feel free to contact me if you know a beter way.</p>

<p><em>(2021-01-06)</em> And here are my routes for Cube. E1-3 is almost entirely auto, while E1-4 is almost entirely manual. E1-2 is somewhat farmable, but E1-3 has more dolls available, can get more checks, and is more auto-friendly.</p>

<p><em>(2020-11-17)</em> Continuum Turbulence is now permanently available!
Get your Pythons today with this handy double drag.
It has 4 checks per run, is resource efficient, and is 100% consistent.</p>

<p>Requirements: 4 strong RFs, 3* statstick fairy, 3 HGs with good tiles. Can grind out levels 90-100 on some of your dolls here too.</p>

<h2 id="fairycraft">Rare Fairy Crafting Strategies<sup><small><a href="extras.html#fairycraft">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CSC17pKJ8BDDm9YYNB8pFqT8k0Np_jWDeu_1X-qJ7yI/edit">All on this spreadsheet.</a></p> Switch tabs to view rateup/non-rateup calculations.

<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> if you want to obtain a Parachute fairy, craft 2000/500/2000/1000 tier 1 or 2 for the best rate. If you need to star up your base fairies, craft lots of 500x4 tier 1.
This is aimed towards efficiently enhancing the rarity of your parachute or other expensive recipe fairies.</p>

<p>The colored cells contain different value metrics of each recipe, with dark green being the most efficient in that column and bright yellow least efficient.</p>

<p>What resource each commander is limited by will vary wildly, so I included several different ways to measure the value of each recipe. Feel free to download/copy the sheet and edit the weightings to your liking.</p>

<p>Overall, 2/5/2/1 tier 1 or 2 and 500x4 look to be strong options for raising parachute fairies specifically - 500x4 for pure resource efficiency, and the expensive recipe to save on cores/contracts.</p>

<p>Once you add other expensive fairies into the mix, 2/2/2/1 does quite well. Upping the parts to 2000 barely helps, decreasing overall resource efficiency. 2/5/2/1 also has pretty high numbers, but it doesn't actually help with raising some of the interesting expensive fairies like combo or landmine. Despite its excellent value with raising just one expensive fairy (parachute), 500x4 falls behind on resource efficiency as you try to raise a range of expensive fairies.</p>

<p>Also of interest: comparing rateup rates to the rates just before, all recipes see a 30-40% increase in total fairy rate. This isn't as good as the 100%+ boost observed in the general doll rateup, but it's certainly not a complete scam and a fair bit higher than the rates described in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/bokege/gfl_crafting_statistics_or_why_sgfairy_rateup_is/">this post from a while back</a>.</p>

<p>Enhancement costs, shared talents, and standard pool fairy XP are not accounted for here. Future rates may vary.</p>


<h2 id="dummyehp">Target Practice Dummy Effective HP<sup><small><a href="extras.html#dummyehp">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<div class="figure">

</div>

<p>Setting different levels of force field let you effectively get different amounts of HP compared to the Strength 1-5 settings. Here's all those combinations. See <a href="dummy.html">this article</a> for more on the target practice dummy.
It should go without saying, but the forcefield settings don't work for this purpose if you use HOCs.</p>

<h2 id="cecorrel">Stage CE/EXP cap correlation<sup><small><a href="extras.html#cecorrel">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/V257ZX9.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>While the level caps and CE ratings of a stage have no inherent need to relate, there is a strong positive correlation between them.
Once you get past ~17000 CE, all stages recorded have caps above level 100.
To go all the way up to level 120, you'll want to start looking at 25000+ CE maps (or just grind 12-4E).</p>

<p>Level penalty numbers taken from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/j1v3lw/weekly_commanders_lounge_september_29_2020/g7lc44o/">/u/UnironicWeeabo's autobattle chart</a>.
This includes campaign stages up to Singularity.
Why do some levels have caps above 120? We may never know.</p>

<h2 id="decoding">Coalition Drill: Decoding Practice rates<sup><small><a href="extras.html#decoding">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>The chances of getting Basic/Advanced Training Keycodes does not seem to be even.
Since I started recording the results, I'm at a 22:66 Advanced:Basic keycode results from it, a 25.0% advanced rate.</p>

<p>Considering a range of possible true probabilities, we can estimate the odds of a result at least this extreme (higher odds = more likely to be the true rate):</p>

<center>
<table style="width:60%">
  <tr>
    <th>"True" probability of getting Advanced Keycodes</th>
    <th>Est. odds of result at least this extreme</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>50%</td>
    <td>0.00028%</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
		<td>30%</td>
		<td>36.5%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>25%</td>
		<td>100%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>20%</td>
		<td>12.3%</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>It is extremely unlikely for the true rate to be 50%.
There's a decent chance of it being 20 or 30%, but a 25% advanced keycode rate appears most likely given my observations so far.</p>

<p>(My understanding is that 25% is the commonly accepted rate on foreign servers, although I'm not certain on its basis. If the odds have been datamined, please do let me know and I can simplify this section. Last updated 2021-07-24.)</p>

<center><em>JS 9's chart.</em></center>

<p>Note that, because JS 9 sits right above a frame breakpoint, ITIs slow her down and perform much worse on her.
The impact of this will lessen if she has ROF buffs that move her away from a breakpoint: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3X6R8zE.png">for example, here's her chart with just +1 base ROF across the board</a>.

<center><em>Honey Badger's chart.</em></center>

<p>ARs/RFs don't need the same type of chart as they have much higher base accuracy - you just always use crit scopes.

<!-- <h2 id="pppp">P22 vs Px4 in Pink/Python<sup><small><a href="extras.html#pppp">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>A few quick comparisons, looking at DPS only:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/extra/pppp-hgs.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>Left: Px4 and P22 are almost equal in terms of DPS, if the enemy has very unrealistic amounts of armor. Right: more typical conditions. Charts zoomed in to show detail.</p>

<p>Px4 Storm is <a href="px4.html">nearly unmatched</a> as a buffer.
In Pink/Python formations, she'll generally outperform P22 even considering the added bonus from Python's reflections and P22's slightly better tiles.
That said, she gives no evasion or shields to your front dolls, so P22 may be preferable depending on what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>M14 used to avoid any tile complications. For example, with R93, you may want to put her on 7 to get her tiles on Px4 Storm.
That starts to add additional variables when she'd go back to 1 (and receive Strawberry's tiles) when P22 is used.
M14 is generally not the best pick here.</p>

<p>A more recent addition that's also worth considering: Webley.</p>

<p>52% ROF from tiles, 28% from Calico's skill, 22% from Webley's skill, and up to 34% from Pink/Python result in a net 218% ROF buff.
A rifle with 38+ ROF will start to lose efficiency from overcap with all skills active.
This doesn't make them immediately unusable, but it's something to consider.
For peace of mind, Rico/Type88/KSVK/IWS all have 37 or less ROF. R93, M14, and Lee Enfield will be at a relative disadvantage.</p> --->
