				<h1>AR Damage over time - how good are the Type sisters?</h1>
				<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2020-November-07 | Draft</em></center>
				<!-- <p>If you just want to see the plots, head over to <a href="">this album</a>.</p> -->

				<p>There are many self-buffing ARs in the game, with all sorts of combinations of stats, buffs, and cooldowns.
					The Type sisters (Type95 and Type97) stand out with their skills taking only <em>2 seconds</em> to activate and lasting for 15 after that.
					Most self-buffing ARs activate between 4 and 6 seconds, with skills usually lasting 5-10 seconds.</p>

				<p>But how valuable are these early activations? How much are the longer ICD dolls hurt by the delay?
					Today, we'll look at how some different ARs perform in cumulative damage dealt, relative to everyone's favorite standard, the G41 scale.</p>

				<p>She herself buffs damage by 75% with an ICD of 4s and a 10s duration, a very generic effect.
				By using this as a reference point, we can see the impact of other timings on damage output.</p>


				<h2>Daytime</h2>

				<p>Thanks to main character syndrome and a neural upgrade, ST AR-15 tops the charts for almost any time.
					Besides her, the type sisters quickly claim their lead after their skills activate, and hold it until 6-8 seconds when G41 catches back up.</p>

				<p>AN-94's passive isn't accounted for here, which may give her an edge early on and when her skill is on cooldown. Note that her curve before 6 seconds is almost identical to AK-12's, and is hidden under it.</p>

				<p>FNC's 3 star statline and skill multiplier make it hard for her to keep up with the rest.</p>

				<!-- <p>EM-2's skill is a little tricky to include with how these are calculated. According to <a href="https://gfl.matsuda.tips/combatsim/">a simulator</a>, she maxes out at a 24.7% net increase 8 seconds in that quickly drops to 12.8% with G41's next shot and continues to fall from there (passing back below around 10.5 seconds).</p> -->

				<h2>Nighttime</h2>

				</div>

				<p>At night, dolls put on their PEQs and AN-94 is swapped out for Groza (OTs-14).
					Between dolls that went straight from a critscope to PEQ, little changes relative to each other.
				As the type sisters lose their SPEQ, they drop down a good amount.</p>

				<p>AR-15 gets a significant advantage as she keeps her critscope, and AK-12 goes down a little bit as her critical rate buff is less valuable.
				While Groza never beats out AR-15 here, keep in mind that this is considering a 0-armor target.
				If you want to know how armor changes matters, <a href="ar-night-armor.html">head on over here</a> for my analysis.
				As long as the fight goes past 6-7 seconds, she performs very well compared to the rest of the ARs here.

				<h2>Keep in mind...</h2>

				<p>Your dolls probably aren't in echelons all by themselves (unless it's some cheap farm route), so other skills and tilebuffs will change how things work out.
					Add a Fervor talent for even more fun.</p>

				<p>Enemy stats will also vary per encounter.</p>

				<p>When in doubt, you can always use <a href="https://gfl.matsuda.tips/combatsim/">a combat simulator</a> to get the specifics.</p>

				<p>These plots use the average total damage per time interval.
					Critical hits, different number of frames between attacks, accuracy rolls, and so on will make the percent difference vary per combat.
					The frame timings of each attack may also cause slight differences with simulators.
					Think of this as a more general average relationship.
