<h1>The Myth of Unsearchable Once-Per-Turn Spells</h1>
</header>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2023-December-26</em></center>

<span class="anchor" id="numbers"></span>
<h2>The Numbers<sup><small><a href="#numbers">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	A somewhat common sentiment online, when it comes to analyzing a new spell in Yugioh, is that it would be much stronger without a name-based use/activation restriction, or much weaker with one.
	An extremely strong effect could be balanced with a once-per-turn restriction.
	There are of course exceptions, but this is often near nonsense.
</p>
<p>
	Some basic numbers, assuming a 40-card deck and 3 copies of the spell in question:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Going first, you have a 33.8% chance of opening at least 1 copy</li>
	<li>Going first, you have a 3.6% chance of opening at least 2 copies (thus a 30.1% chance of opening exactly 1 copy)</li>
	<li>Going first, you have a 0.1% chance of opening all 3 copies</li>
	<li>Going second, you have a 39.4% chance of opening at least 1 copy</li>
	<li>Going second, you have a 5.4% chance of opening at least 2 copies (thus a 34.1% chance of opening exactly 1 copy)</li>
	<li>Going second, you have a 0.2% chance of opening all 3 copies</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Semi-limited cards (like Lightning Storm, at the time of writing) are more severely impacted - going second, it's a 28.1% chance to open 1+, but only a 1.9% chance to see both.
</p>
<p>
	In other words, being able to activate a second/third copy of a given spell will only rarely come up.
	Having a 3-5% chance of being able to activate a second copy of some spell does not suddenly turn it into some super-OP thing.
	Unlimiting ROTA/Monster Reborn/Change of Heart/One for One would make them stronger/more useful, but <em>not</em> because they lack restrictions - it would largely be on their own merits, uses in relevant decks, and improving consistency.
	They are not on the limited list because they lack a once-per-turn restriction.
	Focus on the actual effect.
</p>
<p>
	People play 3 copies of HOPT spells because drawing multiples is unlikely, and drawing your key cards consistently is important.
</p>
<p>
	That's not to say all name-based restrictions are pointless, though.
	Two main factors can make spells much stronger when they don't have restrictions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Being consistently searchable (then, if you open 1, you can use it <em>and</em> search another)</li>
	<li>Your deck draws <em>a lot</em> of cards, making multiples more likely to turn up</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Playing 3 Dark Corridor in Dark World, for example, is a bit risky - it's a strong effect, but you're likely to draw into multiple dead copies later.
	Swordsoul Emergence would get much better in its deck - you can search Mo Ye to start your plays, and (in MD) proceed to get Emergence->Protoss off Chixiao.
	It's also another thing if the card has multiple exclusive effects, particularly a field+GY effect.
	In that case, removing the restriction would often allow you to use both in the same turn and give it much more value.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="conclusion"></span>
<h2>Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Use/activation restrictions on spells necessarily makes them weaker - it's a restriction, after all.
	But for many cards, it's not to any relevant degree.
	Most of the time, you're better off focusing on the actual effect when determining if a spell is good or not.
</ul>
<p>
	Allure of Darkness is strong if you don't mind banishing DARKs from your hand (and have a decent number of them).
	Adding a HOPT would not make it particularly weaker.
	Stake your Soul! would be about as good if it wasn't HOPT.
</p>
<p>
	If a spell/trap on the forbidden/limited doesn't have a once-per-turn restriction, assuming it's not weak enough to come off already, adding a once-per-turn restriction wouldn't change that (unless, like Mass Driver, that's the whole point of the card).
	Reasoning no-errata at 3 is virtually the same outcome as HOPT Reasoning at 3.
</p>
<p>
	You can fairly safely ignore most of the people online analyzing a new card by saying anything along the lines of-
</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Not OPT, so this is definitely good"</li>
	<li>"It would probably need a HOPT to be balanced"</li>
	<li>"I think the OPT restriction kills it"</li>
</ul>
<p>
	They probably don't know what they're talking about and are just falling back on a basic binary checkbox.
	Unless, of course, the effect has some specific interaction with multiple copies/is searchable in a relevant archetype.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="notes"></span>
<h2>Notes<sup><small><a href="#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	I still would generally recommend, from a design standpoint, having HOPT restrictions on spells.
	They don't make the card much weaker, and make it safer long-term - there's less risk of some searcher being printed in the future, or some other way of easily accessing/looping/abusing the card.
	It's also just easier to learn cards if the restrictions are relatively uniform - keeping track of which cards are/aren't HOPT can be annoying for a newer player.
</p>
<p>
	Monsters are a bit of a different case - they are highly accessible from the Deck and GY, so non-HOPT effects become much more abusable.
	It still obviously depends on the effect (Dark Crusader isn't doing anything worth worrying about), but proper restrictions are more important.
