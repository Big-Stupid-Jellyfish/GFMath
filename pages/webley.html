<p>
	At least for EN, Webley introduced the idea of making team positioning matter (outside of deciding who should get a little extra XP/affection).
	There are some easy things to say about Webley:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Webley is a strong pos2 buffing HG.</li>
	<li>She saw heavy use in PL ranking as part of several deathstack-killing RFHGs (Type88+KSVK, Type88+Grape, or just Type88-based ones).</li> <!-- Notice a trend there? -->
	<li>She can give the leader a superbuff (giving FP+ROF+CDR) or, as leader, a normal FP buff to the whole team.</li>
	<li>She has strong FP & ROF tiles: approximately a 39% DPS increase, though frame stuff will make it vary a bit. Some approximate numbers for comparison:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Baseline 5-star HG tiles give a 30% DPS buff (Grizzly).</li>
		<li>Some add accuracy (P22), which is a ~5% improvement at day (roughly a 37% effective buff).</li>
		<li>Some add crit rate (Python), which varies a bit more by the team/fairy but will generally add 5-10% more DPS.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>You should raise your Webley. As she was originally a clear reward, you <a href="limited-dolls">may have to wait a bit to get one</a> if you missed her last appearance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	And a few more difficult questions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>How valuable are each of Webley's buffs, and in what situations?</li>
	<li>In ordinary 2RF3HG echelons, should Webley be the leader?</li>
	<ul>
		<li>In specialist echelons?</li>
	</ul>
	<li>When is she better than P22? Px4 Storm?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's investigate.</p>

<h2 id="whichleader">Leader vs Team buff: Ordinary RFHGs<sup><small><a href="#whichleader">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>
	You can use DPS simulators and get numbers from them, but whether or not those numbers actually mean anything is another problem (at the very least, the team-wide buff will have generally inflated numbers from frontline HGs also getting the buff and may undervalue the ROF component).
	Trying to assign a general number to compare a team-wide FP buff to a specific FP+ROF+CDR buff seems a little extreme, so let's look at it from a different angle.
	If we see a significant overall performance advantage either way in typical fights, it would make sense to recommend one option over the other as a default.
	If there's a big difference each time but the better one changes, you'll need to think carefully about who's leader.
	If they're about the same each time, just go with whichever chibi you think will look cuter on the map.
</p>

<p>
	To start, I'll use an ordinary Rico/R93 RFHG with Webley in place of the usual P22.
	SAA is used in place of Five-Seven/Stechkin to avoid overcap issues.
</p>
<p>
	Simulator prediction: N/A. R93's and Rico's skills cannot be modeled well by a DPS sim.
	CDR on Rico could be good if the fight drags on, and R93 has stellar overall DPS - either seems like a good candidate to buff more.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/webley/test1.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>
	From left to right, considering both clear times and damage taken:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Rico (as leader) appears to have a significant advantage.</li>
	<li>All three options are about equal.</li>
	<li>R93 does worse.</li>
	<li>All three options are about equal.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Next, a typical WA/SVD setup (Mk23/Grizzly/Webley for the handguns).
	WA2000 is oathed, so the rifles are not quite equal in performance.
</p>
<p>
	Simulator prediction: SVD leader, 30006+34282=64288 damage; WA leader, 41995+27062=69057 damage; Webley leader, 36016+31738=67754 damage. 15 eva/10 seconds/rifle damage only/no fairy.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/webley/test2.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<ol>
	<li>All about equal.</li>
	<li>All about equal.</li>
	<li>Possible advantage for WA2000 (reduced damage taken), but close.</li>
	<li>All about equal - by time, WA2000 looks stronger but by damage taken weaker.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="cdr">CDR: Tiles and Skill<sup><small><a href="#cdr">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Most teambuilding is done without going deep into specifics, so the echelons used in my tests above were put together without much thought or calculation aside from making sure a doll wasn't being buffed to 200 ROF.
	Let's go into a few details on both CDR tiles on Webley and her own skill's CDR component.
</p>

<p>
	First of all: Webley's skill can activate before the rifles, but still provide its CDR bonus in some circumstances.
	You can see an example of that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd0AdFkNjGY">here with SVD</a>, but it's not unlimited: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nhw7Sxj9yM">here, no CDR is applied</a>.
</p>

<p>
	This presents another issue with Hycdes - a google translate of their "Special" tab includes the comment
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		In addition, the simulator's skills in the same frame are executed sequentially from positions 1 to 9. If Webley and her captain activate the skills in the same frame, the number of grids they occupy may affect the cooldown of the captain's skills.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	As we can observe Webley's skill applying the CDR even in some cases where her skill activates several frames earlier, this sim may understate her performance.
	<!-- Frame-level optimizations are a bit on the deep side for a general analysis, so I won't go into it much. --> <!-- jk lol I will -->
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<h2 id="notes">Notes<sup><small><a href="#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<ul>
	<li>To compensate for kiting not being practical when collecting large amounts of data, frontline HGs used no HP ammo.</li>
	<li>When running 2 rifles with the same skill type (FP or ROF buff), Webley's skill can be an easy way to mitigate corpse whipping.</li>
	<li>Single-DPS teams are not covered here - it should be rather obvious which mode Webley should be in for those, and that she's much better in that role compared to most buffing handguns.</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
