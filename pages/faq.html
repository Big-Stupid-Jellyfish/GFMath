				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
				<!-- <center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish</em></center> -->

				<p>None, so far. Here's a few I made up though:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>I have a specific question about a post on here</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If you want to see some discussion on each post, there are usually a few comments on my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/BigStupidJellyfish_/submitted/">submissions to Reddit</a>.
				Not being cute fanart means it's usually pretty limited, however.
				Feel free to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=BigStupidJellyfish_&subject=&message=">contact me</a> if you have any further questions.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><em>X</em> new doll/fairy/equipment/thing isn't mentioned, is it bad?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Due to the nature of a live-service game, there is new content constantly being released which will change what strategies/echelons are best.
				Make sure to check the date of these articles and keep that in mind when reading.
				I try to update pages if I see a major need, but I won't be perfect there.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>How do you make your plots?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Almost all my plots/calculations are done in Matlab or R.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>My rankings</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Singularity 1%, CT #93, Isomer 1%, SC 1%, Theater 3 final battle #29, Unavoidable Lie top 30, Dream Catchers top 30 overall (#2 no HG category), Theater 4 #77 overall/#42 final battle, <strong>Polarized Light #10</strong>.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Username from?</li>
				</ul>

				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqfPZcDpJ9E">Here.</a> Note: I like to use generic usernames, and different ones between places.
				Any "BigStupidJellyfish" (or similar variant) on the internet <em>not</em> talking about GF theory is probably not me.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Do you <em>actually</em> stream on twitch?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I stream some of my rankings in each major event, but not much otherwise.
				My youtube channel is much cooler, and has all my ranking VODs anyways.</p>
