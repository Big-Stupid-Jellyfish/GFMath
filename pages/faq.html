<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>None, so far. Here's a few I made up though:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I have a specific question about a post on here</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to see some discussion on each post, there are usually a few comments on my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/BigStupidJellyfish_/submitted/">submissions to Reddit</a>.
Not being cute fanart means the traffic is pretty limited.
Feel free to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=BigStupidJellyfish_&subject=&message=">contact me</a> if you have any further questions.
I am also (sometimes) reachable as BigStupidJellyfish#6974 on Discord.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>X</em> new doll/fairy/equipment/thing isn't mentioned, is it bad?</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the nature of a live-service game, there is new content constantly being released which will change what strategies/echelons are best.
Make sure to check the date of these articles and keep that in mind when reading.
I try to update pages when I see a major need, but I can't be perfect.</p>

<ul>
	<li>How do you make your plots?</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost all my plots/calculations are done in Matlab or R.
This website is hosted using Github pages and written in raw html because I don't know how to make websites.</p>

<ul>
	<li>My rankings</li>
</ul>

<p>Singularity 1%, CT #93, Isomer 1%, SC 1%, Theater 3 final battle #29, Unavoidable Lie #30, Dream Catchers #16 overall (#2 no HG, #7 no 5*), Theater 4 #77 overall/#42 final battle, <strong>Polarized Light #10</strong>, Agent's Reprisal #16.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Username from?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqfPZcDpJ9E">Here.</a> Note: I like to use generic usernames, and different ones between places.
Any "BigStupidJellyfish" (or similar variant) on the internet <em>not</em> talking about GF theory is probably not me and instead some other Mass Effect fan.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do you <em>actually</em> stream on twitch?</li>
</ul>

<p>I stream some of my rankings in each major event, but not much otherwise.
My youtube channel is much cooler, and has almost all my ranking VODs anyways (there's sadly no footage of my #10 PL run due to technical difficulties).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Spoiler disclaimer</li>
</ul>

<p>I only intend to talk about gameplay here, so there shouldn't be many ways to get the plot spoiled.
That said, I may mention enemies/bosses/mechanics/dolls introduced recently, or even new stuff from foreign servers.
If you consider those to be spoilers, please read with caution.</p>
