<h2>The Numbers<sup><small><a href="#numbers">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	If you click on the "odds" button displayed next to a pack, and scroll down to the bottom, you can find this table of glossy/royal chances:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/glossy/rates.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>
	Tentatively, we may assume these to be accurate for cards pulled from packs.
	There would likely be legal trouble otherwise, and I don't particularly care to crawl through masses of pack opening videos.
	But what about crafting?
	As far as I can tell, rates there are not disclosed anywhere in-game.
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/glossy/craftmenu.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>
	We might assume this to be the same as the rate from packs - that would be reasonable enough.
	But why assume when you can test?
	While SR/URs are too expensive to spam craft, I've been collecting my own data recently when trying to get glossy playsets of some random N/R cards.
	It looks something like this:
</p>
<center>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>Card</th>
			<th>Rarity</th>
			<th>Start count</th>
			<th>End count</th>
			<th>Glossy rate</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Lifeless Leaffish</td>
			<td>R</td>
			<td>0/0/-</td>
			<td>33/3/-</td>
			<td>3/33</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Shif, Fairy of the Ghoti</td>
			<td>R</td>
			<td>3/0/-</td>
			<td>97/2/-</td>
			<td>2/94</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Gold Pride - Roller Baller</td>
			<td>N</td>
			<td>2/0/-</td>
			<td>146/3/-</td>
			<td>3/144</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>
	... and so on.
</p>
<p>
	In total, 878 craft attempts resulted in 31 glossy N/R cards - a 3.5% rate.
	The true glossy rate is almost surely (with 99% confidence) at least 2.2% but no more than 5.6%.
	Expect ~30 crafts per glossy, or ~100 for a playset - ~2000 N/R dust after refunds.
	It's possible for SR/UR cards to have odds more in line with the stated rates from packs, but I would be very suspicious based on these results.
</p>
<p>
	Be careful when spending your dust, and be even more careful when deciding whether or not to spend your dollars.

<h2>Notes<sup><small><a href="#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Some people, when it comes to probability, like to come up with increasingly bizarre justifications on what influences the result.
	Maybe you get better odds if you craft exactly on the hour, with a left-hand mouse.
	Maybe you get worse odds if you have at least 3 royal rare cards in the archetype.
	Without evidence these are equally worthless, but I will head off one variation - the batch size does not appear to matter.
	It's a somewhat smaller sample (and more annoying to collect), but my experimental glossy rate for N/R cards is about the same whether 3 are crafted at once or only 1
	(10/212 glossy with batch size 1, reject a 10% glossy rate with p&lt;0.02).
</p>
<p>
	This article is likely to be periodically updated as I craft more glossy cards, and can better narrow down the true rate.
</p>
<p>
	I have also started collecting data on UR/SR crafts, but that will take much longer to get a respectable sample.
	If you would like to contribute, feel free to message me.
	Most critically, any submitted data must be decided as "data to submit" <em>before</em> the crafting takes place.
