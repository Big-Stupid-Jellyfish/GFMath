<h1>TKB-408 Analysis</h1>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2021-September-08 | Last updated 2021-November-30</em></center>

<p>TKB-408 is a 5-star AR originally released in the point event "Maples by the Bridge."
She is a night AR with a slightly atypical skill:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Polar Night Radiance</strong> ICD 5s, CD 16s</p>

<p>During nighttime, increase damage and crit damage by 70% (28% during daytime) for 8 seconds.
If there are more than 3 different gun types present, increase crit rate by 30% while this skill is active (crit rate buff only limited to nighttime).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you just want to know if she's good or not: she's rather bad.
Classic night ARs (OTs-14) are almost always going to perform better, and even those see limited use nowadays considering all the better options out there.
If you want the details, read on.</p>

<h2 id="dps">Direct-fire DPS<sup><small><a href="#dps">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>If she were set to a flat 100% crit rate, her active is a 189% DPS increase with 8/16 uptime.
Typical night ARs (AS Val, OTs-14) have a 200% selfbuff with 6/16 uptime, so she'd trade a slight amount of damage for a 33% longer duration.</p>

<p>Her skill gives the maximum benefit with a pre-skill crit rate of 77%, where its crit rate buff is maximized and her overall DPS increases by 213%.</p>

<p>That isn't practical to hit.
With a PEQ, a Crit II Fury fairy, and its active skill, her crit rate would be only 0.2*1.5*1.25*1.2=45%.
Add M4A1 and UMP45 tiles to get to 72%.
That's close, but it's a contrived setup and Fury is usually significantly worse compared to Command/Para/Artillery.</p>

<p>Assuming no crit rate buffs, her crit rate is 20% pre-skill/26% with active.
In that case, her skill is about a 116% DPS increase.
For another reference point, G41's skill is a 75% DPS increase with 10/16 uptime.
TKB does ~23% more DPS with her skill but it ends 20% faster, ignoring ICD.</p>

<p>That looks a bit closer, but now we've downgraded a shiny new night specialist AR to the level of an ancient bog-standard AR.</p>

<h2 id="dot">Damage over time<sup><small><a href="#dot">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>Let's look at her damage contribution relative to some other ARs over time (<a href="g41-standard">like in this earlier writeup</a>).
This can be useful to see how much of an impact her ICD and skill duration has on her overall damage output.
Starting with no tiles/other buffs, TKB in the orange:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/tkb-408/dot-night.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>AS Val is assumed to have FP buff uptime from Python+a Fervor fairy, although the actual FP buffs are not applied here to keep the model simple.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that OTs-14 has a bit higher ROF (75 vs 72) but fires <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k74SCGGMHtwbl8gmTaETLsa8t12A7dWdj0V1tjdMD4Y/edit">on the same frame</a>, causing her to lag behind a bit here when combined with her lower base damage.
Many ROF buffs will put OTs-14 on a higher frame than TKB, significantly improving her relative DPS.
<a href="images/tkb-408/dot-night-rof.png">One example with +15% ROF</a>: TKB is now essentially always worse than OTs-14.
AR-15 and Angelica also go down a bit relatively as they can't benefit from ROF in-skill.</p>

<p>
	For the full list of (somewhat practical) tiles and if they help OTs-14 more:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/tkb-408/roftiles.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>Buffing crit damage doesn't help her relative value much, especially with things like AR-15 and AS Val on the table:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/tkb-408/dot-night-para.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>I could resize the chart to fit AS Val but I think this gets the point across.</p>

<p>So: TKB may have a slight advantage over OTs-14 in very short battles (<6 seconds) and long ones (>12 seconds) when no ROF buffs are involved.
However, she does not come close to the top night ARs and at best is ~10% better than generic stuff like G41.
The slightly improved skill duration vs typical night ARs is not worth the cost to its strength.</p>

<p>Note that these charts smooth out each doll's DPS.
Depending on which exact frame you check in a given battle, the relative numbers will fluctuate if one doll's shot just connected and the other's is still in flight, or when one of the million different random factors of real battles comes into play.
Some ARs may also get an extra shot in at the end of their skill, or fall barely short of one, which will change relative numbers a bit as well.</p>

<h2 id="armor">Damage against armor<sup><small><a href="#armor">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>Crit damage is calculated after applying damage reduction from armor.
While this is <a href="px4#armor">not even remotely a concern</a> with Px4 Storm in RFHG echelons, ARs tend to lack the AP & FP needed to ignore this mechanic.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/tkb-408/dot-night-armor.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>TKB in the blue this time, with a 5* Damage II Artillery (1.55*1.15=78% total FP buff).
Varying FP buffs will shift the x-axis around but overall trends would be similar.</p>

<p>TKB does better against armor than G41, but a pure FP buff like what OTs-14/AS Val have is clearly superior against armor.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this is in-skill DPS - dolls with short/burst skills will generally be rated higher than ones with high uptime here.
Using uptime-averaged DPS or something similar has its own problems though as almost all ARs will be totally blocked by armor out-of-skill and few fights last multiple skill cycles.</p>

<p>WA2000 included for reference. Don't use ARs to fight Hydras.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>Night ARs as a whole see limited use in the current RFHG-dominated meta.
If you do need them, AS Val+Python+AR-15 will cover 99% of your needs.
When TKB is only sometimes better than old night ARs like OTs-14 and not far off from day ARs like G41, it's hard to imagine you'd be hurting to fill teams without her.
A number of other ARs (e.g., AS Val, AR-15, Angelica) will benefit as much or more than TKB from realistic levels of crit buffs, so she doesn't even get to claim that specialty.</p>

<p>To be fair, TKB's skill is at least functional.
She's hardly in the category of dolls like JS05 or 100 Shiki who have downright awful skills.
If you want a night AR that shoots things, don't care about the details, and already have her raised, it's possible to use TKB.</p>

<p>With lackluster performance even in her niche, I <strong>do not recommend raising TKB-408</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Other considerations<sup><small><a href="#considerations">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>Her tiles are decent to put on an offtank (+25% FP, +50% ACC), but are awkward to position as you'd often have a HG on 4 at night.
She can still sit there if using Desert Eagle/HP-35/C-93/P22 or similar as your handgun.
If on 1 or 7, her tiles are a non-factor for any sane echelon.</p>

<!--
<p>In the future with Galil mod, it may be possible to use her with a crit scope at night against regular enemies.
Her skill would be better there, and I'd probably prefer her to OTs-14.
I don't know how viable Galil mod setups are in general though, and AS Val is still a thing.</p> -->

<!-- <p>I am assuming her skill text means "3 or more," so HG+AR+SMG would work.
Some translations, including the in-game text, have said "more than 3" which would make that component of her skill very awkward to trigger.
If that is the case, ignore that sentence and never try to fit a random RF into an echelon that doesn't need one just to slightly boost the crit rate of an AR at night.</p> -->
<p>The charts and analysis above include lines with the crit rate boost from her skill.
It requires more than 3 doll types in the echelon, so standard AR/HG/SMG night echelons would not give her that crit rate buff and she'd be follow the slightly weaker <4 gun type lines.
A 30% crit buff on top of a 20% base is not much anyways (only bringing her to 26% crit rate) so this shouldn't affect your decision making.
I do not recommend trying to build teams around that component of her skill.
An out-of-place RF/MG/SG will hurt echelon performance far more than a minor crit rate buff on a subpar AR would help.
It's a similar deal to SL8 - missing out on a HG's 30%+ tiles and 25%+ DPS buff skill for 5% damage on 1 RF is an awful trade.</p>

<p>Charts here are without affection bonuses.
Having max affection/oaths may slightly change the exact percentages, but it won't be anything major.</p>

<p>
	<!-- Any possible Galil mod interactions aren't covered as we don't have her mod on EN yet and I'm not sure of the viability of such setups in general. -->
	Any possible Galil mod interactions aren't covered as I'm not convinced of the viability of such setups in general.
	I'm also not entertaining the idea of running her with a crit scope against 0 evasion enemies - running a dedicated team to fight 0 evasion (armored) enemies and picking <em>ARs</em> for your DPS is simply absurd. RFs and MGs exist.
</p>

<p>
	Speaking of the future, as a new AR without a popular following, TKB is less likely to receive a SPEQ or neural upgrade in the future.
	Crit synergy in general will be less interesting for ARs once we get the <a href="newquip#2chip">#2 Chip</a> equipment.

<h2 id="formations">Echelon ideas<sup><small><a href="#formations">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>While she isn't a priority, here are some example formations you can use TKB in.
Echelons should always be built depending on the enemy, your armory, and various other requirements so please don't copy these 1:1.</p>

<p>Left: an AS Val variant, if you have a strong aversion to AR-15/Sopmod/good night ARs. Right: an example making use of her tiles.</p>
