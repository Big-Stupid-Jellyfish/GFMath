<h1>AK-47 with 74M</h1>
</header>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2022-May-29</em></center>

<p>
	AK-74M is expected to release next month as a new craftable doll, with an interesting skill:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><strong>Katyusha</strong> ICD 0s/CD 0s</p>
	<p>
		T-Dolls in the echelon carrying an [AK] are enhanced;
		<ul>
			<li>[AK-74M]: All T-Dolls wielding an AK in the echelon gain 5% damage and rate of fire.</li>
			<li>[AK-47]: "Strike Focus" damage and accuracy buffs are swapped.</li>
			<li>[AK-74U]: "Purge Reaction" is buffed to a passive.</li>
			<li>[AK-12]: "Eye of the White Mastiff" grants an additional 35% critical hit damage while it is active.</li>
			<li>[AK-15]: Attacks will always trigger her "Anger" effect.</li>
			<li>[AK-Alfa]: Has perfect accuracy when targeting enemy units in front of her.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	She provides unique passive buffs to all the AK-style dolls listed.
</p>
<p>
	There's a whole lot to consider there, so for now let's just look at her interaction with AK-47.
	After all, AW+ has finally been announced for Q3 per Q&A - maybe AK-47's scope SPEQ and this is enough to be worth considering.
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><strong>Strike Focus</strong> ICD 5s/CD 8s</p>
	<p>
		Increase damage by 35% and accuracy by 100% for 5 seconds.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	This skill is the main reason why AK-47 has never been recommended, with poor DPS stats as the nail in the coffin.
	A 35% multiplier is simply terrible even by 3-star standards, and the accuracy buff mostly just brings her accuracy back to normal levels.
</p>
<p>
	But switching that to a 100% FP multiplier, plus 44% crit damage from her best scope, has a shot at being worth something.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="dps"></span>
<h2>DPS calculations<sup><small><a href="#dps">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	AK-47's scope favors crit builds, which are generally better for ARSMGs anyways.
	Let's look at the in- and out-of-skill DPS of her and a few other options, assuming a Parachute fairy without talent.
</p>

	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>Configuration</th>
			<th>Basic DPS</th>
			<th>In-skill DPS</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>AK-47 (VFL+Chip)</td>
			<td>1050.1</td>

</center>
<p>
	AK-47's SPEQ alone is clearly not enough to make her useful.
	However, pairing that with AK-74M appears to bring her DPS to a similar range as G41 (+M4A1 & SPEQ), one of the <a href="g41-standard">better "boring" direct-fire DPS ARs</a>.
</p>
<p>
	We have a lead, but we're a bit short of a full argument.
	Let's go deeper.
</p>
<span class="anchor" id="dot"></span>
<h2>Damage over time<sup><small><a href="#dot">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	AK-74M's tiles aren't <em>too</em> far off from M4's, so let's suppose our third AR doesn't care either way.
	First, we'll chart the relative cumulative damage over time from G41 & AK-74M with support, and then add the support AR DPS to see how much it affects things (M4A1 is pretty good on her own!).
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/474m/ak474m-separate.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	Lining up with the DPS table above, we see AK-47 start out with marginally better DPS.
	Once her skill activates 5 seconds in, she quickly catches up.
	From ~7 seconds onwards, ignoring one minor dip, AK-47 keeps a decent advantage over G41.
</p>
<p>
	However, the support AR's damage is concerning.
	We expect G41 & AK-47 to outperform M4/74M as they're getting fairly substantial tiles, but AK-74M is <em>really</em> far down.
	She has her own permanent 5% FP & ROF buff, but that's a far cry from M4A1's 75% selfbuff (and crazy mod3 SPEQ).
</p>
<p>
	Now, the same chart but adding G41 & M4's numbers as well as 47 & 74M's:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/474m/ak474m-combined.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	AK-74M's DPS drags down the team, and G41+M4A1 have better performance no matter how long the battle goes on for.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="conclusion"></span>
<h2>Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	It looks like AK-47 can deal a surprising amount of damage when you have everything set up right.
	However, if your third AR isn't getting <em>amazing</em> value out of AK-74M, it seems to still be a net negative for echelon DPS compared to standard options.
	And even those "standard options" pale in comparison to the very top meta ARs (e.g., G11/416 mods), though those are a bit harder to plot on a graph like this.
</p>
<p>
	This only sort of works at day, and AK-47's tiles aren't helpful (not that those are a major consideration).
	It ultimately looks better than <a href="sub2k">SUB-2000-based echelons</a>, at least - those waste an entire echelon's worth of data for absolutely no performance return.
</p>
<span class="anchor" id="notes"></span>
<h2>Notes<sup><small><a href="#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Field testing, as always, will be helpful once these toys actually arrive on EN. Theoretical calculations <a href="simulation">only get you so far</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		As you may have noticed from the table earlier, AK-47's SPEQ is a necessary part to keep her somewhat competitive. This will not work at night.
	</li>
	<li>
		While concerns over low accuracy are often <a href="myths#hanyangacc">unfounded</a>, AK-47's accuracy is actually bad - 37 at lv100, with 100 affection.
		Her out-of-skill DPS will suffer more than her competitors if your enemies have somewhat more evasion than typical, if you're not running dolls/fairies that give accuracy.
	</li>
</ul>
