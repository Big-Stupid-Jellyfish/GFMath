	<p><strong>Queglix Gun Special Attack</strong> Range 6. Attack 1, 2, or 3.</p>

		Major Q9 starts each turn with 9 attack dice.
		Choose any figure within range and attack by rolling 1, 2, or 3 attack dice.
		Major Q9 may keep making special attacks with 1, 2, or 3 attack dice until he has rolled all 9 attack dice.
		Major Q9 may target the same or different figures with each attack.

	Major Q9's special attack has a decent degree of flexibility, allowing you to split your dice into 4 different reasonable schemes.
	But which one's best, and when?
	Should you ever just use his basic attack?
	<a href="https://imgur.com/jWcmMPi">The full card of the unit in question.</a>
</p>
<p>
	First, let's look at the average damage dealt by his attack options, versus variable enemy defense.

</div></center>
<p>
	Assuming no weird special abilities are in play, things are quite simple: use the Queglix Gun, 3x3.
	The only exception is if you have height advantage, and the enemy has 8 or more defense.
</p>
<p>
	However, this is assuming all your attacks are against an infinite-health target.
	That's fine enough versus heroes, but squads should be considered separately - they all have 1 life, so anything more than 1 wound is always wasted.
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/hsc-q9/q9modesSquads.png" width="100%"/>
</div></center>
<p>
	Unsurprisingly, 1x9 is now best at low defense values. At 2 defense, 1x9/2x4+1x1/2x3+3x1 are all effectively equal.
	(Their average squads killed at that point are respectively ~2.00/2.00/1.96.)
	At 3 defense and beyond, 3x3 is best.
	Even with height advantage, normal attacks are never worth it against squads.
</p>

<p>
	Extreme height and other uncommon buffs are not accounted for.
	You can probably imagine about where the line would fall if you add another die to his regular attacks.
