<h1>1 "C" is better than 3</h1>

<p>
	Maxx "C" is legal at 3 copies in the OCG and Master Duel.
	It is banned in the TCG, which is rather clearly the best approach.
	Let's consider its situation in Master Duel.
	A common sentiment, even among players who want it banned, goes along the lines of:
	"While Maxx 'C' sucks, it's better at 3 than 1. This makes it less sacky."
	That idea is ridiculous.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="probability"></span>
<h2>Probability<sup><small><a href="#probability">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Let's work out some general probabilities for turn 1.
	Assuming a 40-card deck, 5 card hand:
</p>
<center>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>Number of copies</th>
			<th>Odds of seeing 1+</th>
			<th>Number of copies</th>
			<th>Odds of seeing 1+</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>12.5%</td>
			<td>6</td>
			<td>57.7%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>23.7%</td>
			<td>7</td>
			<td>63.9%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>33.8%</td>
			<td>8</td>
			<td>69.4%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>42.7%</td>
			<td>9</td>
			<td>74.2%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>50.7%</td>
			<td>10</td>
			<td>78.3%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>
	You can use a <a href="https://stattrek.com/online-calculator/hypergeometric">hypergeometric calculator</a> or websites like <a href="https://yugioh.party/">this one</a> to get these values.
</p>
<p>
	At the moment, if you're not playing a deck exceptionally well-positioned against Maxx "C", 9/40 cards are typically dedicated to the EARTH Insect: 3 Maxx "C", 3 Ash Blossom, 2 Called By, and 1 Crossout.
	When going first, your odds look something like this:
</p>
<center>
	<em>3 "C", 6 counters</em>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>No Maxx "C"</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" but drew counter</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" and no counter</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>66.2%</td>
			<td>19.5%</td>
			<td>14.3%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>
	So you're spending 9 deck slots and are (likely) to lose to Maxx "C" 14.3% of the time.
	Crossout isn't a particularly good card, so you might try to cut it:
</p>
<center>
	<em>3 "C", 5 counters</em>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>No Maxx "C"</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" but drew counter</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" and no counter</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>66.2%</td>
			<td>17.1%</td>
			<td>16.7%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>
	It's only 1 card, so the odds don't change that much.
	If you also cut Called By:
</p>
<center>
	<em>3 "C", 3 counters</em>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>No Maxx "C"</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" but drew counter</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" and no counter</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>66.2%</td>
			<td>11.4%</td>
			<td>22.4%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>
	Quite unpleasant.
	Now, let's try limiting Maxx "C" to 1 and re-run the numbers.
</p>
<center>
	<em>1 "C", 6 counters</em>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>No Maxx "C"</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" but drew counter</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" and no counter</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>87.5%</td>
			<td>7.2%</td>
			<td>5.3%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<center>
	<em>1 "C", 5 counters</em>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>No Maxx "C"</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" but drew counter</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" and no counter</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>87.5%</td>
			<td>6.3%</td>
			<td>6.2%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<center>
	<em>1 "C", 3 counters</em>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>No Maxx "C"</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" but drew counter</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" and no counter</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>87.5%</td>
			<td>4.2%</td>
			<td>8.3%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<center>
	<em>1 "C", 0 counters</em>
	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>No Maxx "C"</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" but drew counter</th>
			<th>Maxx "C" and no counter</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>87.5%</td>
			<td>0%</td>
			<td>12.5%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>
	In other words: even if you completely cut every single Maxx "C" counter, the odds of it resolving are still lower with 1 "C" legal when compared to 3 "C"/6 counters.
	And even if, emotionally, the few times Maxx "C" resolves end up feeling a bit worse, I'd much rather have ~6% of my games be lost to random Maxx "C" variance than 15%.
	(Not to mention it can't be used multiple turns in a row if limited.)
	With 1 Maxx "C", you can play all the same decks as before.
	You can play the same number of counters, or less.
	And whichever way you choose, it'll end less games.
</p>

<p>
	Going second is not really possible to analyze in the same manner.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The turn 1 player may set up negates/shufflers/other ways of ensuring their Maxx "C" resolves.</li>
	<li>They could draw through more of their deck and pick up a Maxx "C" mid-turn.</li>
	<li>If you (as the turn 2 player) open with 1 Ash and use it on turn 1, you won't have it to negate a Maxx "C" on your turn.</li>
	<li>Called By on turn 1 will still linger for turn 2 - potentially on both Maxx "C" and Ash.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	And of course, considerations will vary by meta.
	For example - Dimensional Shifter/Fissure will alter the odds and strategies.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="conclusion"></span>
<h2>Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Maxx "C" is a blight on the game.
	The fewer games it decides, the better.
	If Konami refuses to outright <em>ban</em> the card, limiting it would still improve the situation (and ease the transition to banning it later).
	But it absolutely should be banned.
</p>
<p>
	Some other complications not considered here, though they're not super relevant to the net odds:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Drawing into a Maxx "C" counter (but Maxx "C" can just be chained to desires)</li>
	<li>Counter counters like Ghost Belle and Gamma</li>
</ul>
