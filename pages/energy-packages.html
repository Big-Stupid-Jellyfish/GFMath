<h2>Gem Packages<sup><small><a href="#gem">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>
	Pretty much everything gameplay-related (pre-SF capture) can be obtainable 100% F2P, so there's hardly an obligation to spend money on things like data.
	Many of the top rankers each event are entirely free-to-play.
	If you do plan on it though, here's how to get your money's worth.
</p>

<p>
	Batteries and most other extras are not considered here.
	The net value of each package is converted to a shop price index (SPI), where SPI values greater than 1 indicate the package is better value than buying its components individually from the shop.
	This does not necessarily mean the package is worth buying - there could be other, better deals (even higher SPI), or the shop price could be a terrible deal.
	A T-Doll contract package could have an SPI of 100 and still be useless because you can just run 0-2/13-4 logistics.
</p>

<p>
	Calibration tickets are valued at 52 per 5 energy (going to wave 107).
	Defense Drill will be reworked in the future making these more abundant, so I'd advise against spending too much on these at the moment.
	SF Keycodes are valued at 9 energy/252 (Advanced) and 0 energy/252 (Basic) based on <a href="sfstats">my current understanding of their relative rates and need</a>.
	Aid commissions are valued at 112 gems per, despite their shop price being 160 gems.
	This is because you can get 30 for this rate at the start of each SF banner (monthly), which should be more than enough for almost everyone.
</p>

<p>
	Warning: at some indefinite point in the future, client 2.09 will be released.
	It makes defense drills much more efficient, and may include times with double sim rewards.
	Then, the value of data/tickets will be far lower than the previous evaluations.
	I've added a (x2) column which evaluates each package with that considered.
	<!-- Once a release date for that client has been confirmed I'll adjust the evaluations accordingly.
	Until then, buy data packages at your own risk. -->
</p>
<p>
	Some more recent additions have additional comments in hovertext.

<h2>2.09 Client 7-day packages<sup><small><a href="#newclient">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	A few packages will be introduced with the 2.09 client, as part of a revamped new player experience.
	To clarify, I've bolded the parts of each package that actually factor into its evaluation.
	As before, a SPI>1 means it is more cost-efficient than standard shop pricing.
	This does not necessarily make the package worthwhile - you'd still need what it offers and be willing to pay the price.

<p>
	Note that while some of these packages include large amounts of cores/resources/contracts, these are all things that can be acquired in massive quantities after just a few days of logistics/grinding.
	You may wish to place some amount of additional value on these, but please keep it very small.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="dollar"></span>
<h2>Direct Purchase Packages<sup><small><a href="#dollar">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>There are also some packages available for direct purchase only.
I'll compare these instead in terms of their Gems per dollar equivalent, assuming the alternative is buying gems -> buying extra energy -> running simulations.
All prices given in USD, without tax. More gems/$ is better.</p>

<h2>Aid Commissions<sup><small><a href="#aidcomm">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>
	To offer some resistance against package bloat, here's another take on aid commission packages with all the extras stripped away.
	Given the daily special supply value of 121.21 gems/$, we can talk about the aid commission packages in terms of the number of commissions gotten per dollar spent (higher is better):
</p>

<center>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>Package</th>
		<th>Contents</th>
		<th>Price</th>
		<th>Effective commissions/$</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Aid Commission special offer (each banner)</td>
		<td>Aid Commission x20 (+1000x advanced keycodes)</td>
		<td>$23.99</td>
		<td>0.83</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Xmas Special Supply (2021-12)</td>
		<td>Aid Commission x30 (+2000x advanced keycodes, 1x name change card)</td>
		<td>$29.99</td>
		<td>1.00</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tiger Year Exclusive Package (2022-02)</td>
		<td>Advanced x1888, Advanced Keycode x1888, Aid Commission x20</td>
		<td>2888 gems</td>
		<td>0.84</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Coalition Units Supply Package (each banner)</td>
		<td>Aid Commission x10 (+1000x basic keycodes)</td>
		<td>1120 gems</td>
		<td>1.08</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Standard shop pricing</td>
		<td>Aid Commission x1</td>
		<td>160 gems</td>
		<td>0.76</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Which would indicate that the real-money package is better than the infinitely-available price, but not by much.
If you spend less and only buy the monthly cards, you may prefer to say that you can get 225 gems or so per dollar, so this instead looks like:</p>

<center>
<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>Package</th>
		<th>Contents</th>
		<th>Price</th>
		<th>Effective commissions/$</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Aid Commission special offer (2021-06)</td>
		<td>Aid Commission x20</td>
		<td>$23.99</td>
		<td>0.83</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Xmas Special Supply (2021-12)</td>
		<td>Aid Commission x30 (+2000x advanced keycodes, 1x name change card)</td>
		<td>$29.99</td>
		<td>1.00</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tiger Year Exclusive Package (2022-02)</td>
		<td>Advanced x1888, Advanced Keycode x1888, Aid Commission x20</td>
		<td>2888 gems</td>
		<td>1.56</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Coalition Units Supply Package (2021-06)</td>
		<td>Aid Commission x10</td>
		<td>1120 gems</td>
		<td>2.01</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Standard shop pricing</td>
		<td>Aid Commission x1</td>
		<td>160 gems</td>
		<td>1.41</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>where the real-money package is much worse.</p>
