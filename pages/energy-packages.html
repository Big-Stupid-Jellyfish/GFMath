<h2 id="gem">Gem Packages<sup><small><a href="energy-packages.html#gem">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>Pretty much everything gameplay-related (pre-SF capture) can be obtainable 100% F2P, so there's hardly an obligation to spend money on things like data.
Many of the top rankers each event are entirely free-to-play.
If you do plan on it though, here's how to get your money's worth.</p>

<p>Batteries and most other extras are not considered here. The net value of each package is converted to effective energy per gem, with higher energy/gem being better.</p>

<p>Calibration tickets are valued at 52 per 5 energy (going to wave 107).</p>

<!-- <p>The Division Supply Package (2021-01) & the White Day Supply Package (2021-03) are a little unusual - they contain 330 gems & 500 advanced data for $4.99 USD.
Assuming a typical data value of 0.15 energy/gem, this package is equivalent to around 104 gems/$. For comparison: monthly card gets you 225 gems/$, first-time purchase packages are around 130 gems/$, and gem packages after that are around 80 gems/$.
Possibly worth it if you often buy gems after the first-time bonus and want advanced data, but not worth it otherwise.</p> -->

<h2 id="dollar">Direct Purchase Packages<sup><small><a href="energy-packages.html#dollar">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>There are also some packages available for direct purchase only.
I'll compare these instead in terms of their Gems per dollar equivalent, assuming the alternative is buying gems -> buying extra energy -> running simulations.
All prices given in USD, without tax. More gems/$ is better.</p>

<p>Note: I include calibration tickets in these evaluations. If you have little to no need for them, those packages will be a worse deal.</p>

<h2 id="aidcomm">Aid Commissions<sup><small><a href="energy-packages.html#aidcomm">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>With the release of SF capture, we have some new packages to consider.
The aid commissions are a little difficult, as their value can't be compared easily with energy-based items.
You could take the shop price of 1 commission for 160 gems, but that's not necessarily a good deal for your money.
If you think it is, the Coalition Units Supply Package with 10 of them plus a little data for 1120 gems is obviously good, being a straight discount with extras.
I don't really want to present total values based on that number and adding the little extras because the main point of these is the aid commissions.</p>

<p>Given the daily special supply value of 121.21 gems/$, we can talk about the aid commission packages in terms of the number of commissions gotten per dollar spent (higher is better):</p>

<center>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Package</th>
    <th>Contents</th>
    <th>Price</th>
		<th>Effective commissions/$</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Aid Commission special offer (2021-06)</td>
    <td>Aid Commission x20</td>
    <td>$23.99</td>
		<td>0.834</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Coalition Units Supply Package (2021-06)</td>
    <td>Aid Commission x10</td>
    <td>1120 gems</td>
		<td>1.082</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Standard shop pricing</td>
    <td>Aid Commission x1</td>
    <td>160 gems</td>
		<td>0.758</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Which would indicate that the real-money package is better than the infinitely-available price, but not by much.
If you spend less and only buy the monthly cards, you may prefer to say that you can get 225 gems or so per dollar, so this instead looks like:</p>

<center>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Package</th>
    <th>Contents</th>
    <th>Price</th>
		<th>Effective commissions/$</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Aid Commission special offer (2021-06)</td>
    <td>Aid Commission x20</td>
    <td>$23.99</td>
		<td>0.834</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Coalition Units Supply Package (2021-06)</td>
    <td>Aid Commission x10</td>
    <td>1120 gems</td>
		<td>2.013</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Standard shop pricing</td>
    <td>Aid Commission x1</td>
    <td>160 gems</td>
		<td>1.409</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>where the real-money package is much worse.</p>

<p>There's also a new daily special offer package containing 1 aid commission, 200 advanced keycodes, and 100 batteries for 158 gems.
This is obviously better than the standard shop pricing but worse than the coalition units supply package in terms of aid commissions.
If you are interested in the advanced keycodes as well and value those,
<ul>
	<li>If you value 1 aid commission at 160 gems, this package is the equivalent of ~0.167 energy/gem (~11% better value)</li>
	<li>If you value 1 aid commission at 112 gems, this package is the equivalent of ~0.121 energy/gem (~20% worse value)</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's not worthwhile if you only plan to buy the 10x commission for 1120 bundles, even considering the data.
It would be worth it if you do plan to buy the 1 for 160 packages, especially considering the data.</p>

<p>Note: basic data may be considered less worthwhile compared to advanced data: SF skills require about a 1.7:1 ratio of basic:advanced keycodes, but the simulators <a href="sfstats.html#decoding">appear to give data at around a 3:1 ratio</a>.
Over time, people are likely to build up a surplus of basic data and have much less use for it.</p>
