<!-- <p>Several new equipment pieces were recently announced on foreign servers.
There are some interesting ideas in them, but let's see if they are worth your time.</p>

<p>Important note: it may be quite a while before they are available to craft on EN. Don't get too excited. No date has been confirmed.</p> -->

<p>
	<em>(2021-12-14 update): Rather unexpectedly, these equipment pieces have been released on EN.
	A number of <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/443533099632951306/857458294863953930/2021-06-23_20_12_49.png">SPEQ balance adjustments</a> were also released accordingly.
	Good luck in your crafting.</em>
</p>

<p>
	Seven new equipment pieces have been introduced, with something to offer for every class.
	Let's go over them one-by-one and see if they are worth your resources.

<h2 id="rmr">RMR T4<sup><small><a href="#rmr">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by HG/MG/AR-15/Sopmod. Replaces suppressor/scope.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +20 ACC, +30% crit chance.</p>

<p>For HGs: this is a straight upgrade over a typical suppressor (+10 EVA, +20% crit chance) for DPS/backline HGs, and a straight downgrade for frontline/tanking HGs as it gives no evasion.</p>

<p>For MGs: it depends on a few factors, namely your accuracy, enemy evasion, crit rate buffs, and crit damage.
I prefer to only use MGs against 0 EVA enemies, where the RMR T4 has no advantage over a crit scope.
A few common scenarios with evasion:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/mgscope.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<center><em>Crossover chart for typical MG accuracy/evasion combinations. If your acc/eva combo is above the curve for your setup, use the RMR T4. If below, use a VFL.</em></center>

<p>Typical SF have ~15 evasion. Somewhat dodgy enemies can have 20-40 EVA, and Scouts are higher than almost everything with 80 EVA.
For some sample accuracies, at max level/100 affection, PKP has 33 acc, Negev 37, and Kord 24 (pierce mode).
In short: the RMR T4 is better than a critscope on most MGs against most evasive enemies in most setups.
Still, never try this at night.</p>

<p>
	For AR-15/Sopmod: it's much easier to get ARs to 100% crit rate with dolls like M4/UMP45.
	Consider using this if your team doesn't have crit rate sources.
	The RMR is somewhat less attractive on Sopmod as it doesn't help her grenade damage.
	To help give a general sense of this relationship:

<h2 id="2chip">#2 Processor Chip<sup><small><a href="#2chip">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by AR/SMG. Replaces T/X-Exoskeletons.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +15 FP, +25 ROF, -50% critical damage.</p>

<p>This is an interesting one, giving major FP/ROF bonuses in exchange for a <em>lot</em> of critical damage. <strong>For a full analysis, see <a href="chips">my writeup here</a>.</strong> A few basic things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chips, when paired with the right scope, are around a 25% DPS buff over classic VFL+Exo combinations. Don't pass these up. (ROF selfbuffers see much less benefit, if any.) </li>
	<li>At night you don't crit much anyways, making them even better picks (see tables 3 (Artillery fairy) & 4 (command fairy) <a href="https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=micateam&no=1665096&exception_mode=recommend&page=1">here</a>).</li>
	<li>Chips use an exo slot, so ST AR-15 and M4 SOPMOD II are not able to equip them.</li>
	<li>Picking the right scope is rather complicated, and a <a href="https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html">damage simulator</a> will usually be your best bet.</li>
	<li>For a generic setup and a few common dolls, here's how an EOT and VFL compare as a function of fairy crit damage aura:</li>
</ul>

</div>
<ul>
	<li>For overall DPS optimization <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0FLOsxysAScY_ehWpf-vI8R2wohgxm8nqncXqZC2bQ/edit#gid=787582090">this spreadsheet</a>
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c0JhaSX9WyL3EB-7RCDE4NrfzR1YuWdYWidQ_06-PrQ/edit#gid=1239433445">or this one</a>, both by Mis, are probably the most comprehensive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The #2 Chip is very strong and will see use in many ARSMG formations.
	It is not always optimal - high ROF, crit rate, and crit damage may lessen its value.
	It can reasonably be paired with both VFLs & EOTs, depending on the situation.
</p>
<!-- I recommend using <a href="https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html">a combat simulator</a> to check numbers for each specific team/enemy combination you are interested in. -->

<!-- <p>At night, few ARs can get decent crit rates. There, the chip looks even better as long as it doesn't massively overcap ROF.</p> -->

<h2 id="slap">MK1000 SLAP Rounds<sup><small><a href="#slap">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by MG. Replaces AP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +500 AP, -5 ROF.</p>

<p>ROF only has a minor effect on MG reload speed and doesn't change their actual firing speed.
Use this over standard AP ammo when enemy armor is greater than 195 (180 AP ammo + 15 base AP).
You can look up enemy stats on any map <a href="https://pengupengupengu.github.io/gflmaps/">with GFLMaps</a>.
Applications are currently limited - few enemies have this much armor, and those that do go a bit above 200 are often best fought with RFHG echelons.
This has a bit more potential with Kord, who loses 50% of her AP in pierce mode.
Future (unreleased) enemies will also have even higher armor values.</p>

<p>
	A few examples of how it affects reload speed (or rather, how it doesn't):
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/slap.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>
	Green SLAP rounds are a nice budget alternative to normal AP ammo on MGs - they provide ~190-195 AP before any calibration/enhancement, and are trivial to get from the IOP Special Orders (though the 5-star rates are <a href="https://gf-db.github.io/gfdb/gfdb.html?mp=10&ammo=300&mre=10&part=10&tier=-1&type=equip_recipe&epoch.equip=22.0">also high there</a>).
</p>

<h2 id="aps">M1022 Sniper Rounds<sup><small><a href="#aps">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by RF/MG. Replaces AP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +120 AP, +10 FP.</p>

<p>For enemy armor>AP, FP is largely interchangeable with AP.
Use if enemy armor is less than 145 (120 ammo + 15 base + 10 FP buff), or a bit more if you have some FP buffs:</p>

<!-- Yes, armor overpenetration is a thing. 143 is technically a fine crossover, but you generally have FP buffs and 145 is easier to remember/hardly different. Similar deal with SLAP ammo. -->

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/sniperrounds.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>Some mods have SPEQs that are a straight upgrade from this - KSVK & NTW have AP ammo that gives +180 AP/+10 FP, for example. Otherwise, it's a nice damage boost against low/no-armor targets.</p>



<h2 id="bird">#7.5 Birdshot<sup><small><a href="#bird">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by SG. Replaces SG shells.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +12 ROF, +2 targets, -10% crit rate.</p>

<p>
	More targets means more potential knockback. The relative value of this compared to Buckshot (shoots the normal 3 targets/+15 FP/+22% crit damage) will likely vary per encounter.
	The next ammo option makes these substantially less exciting.
</p>

<h2 id="flash">Shotgun Flash Shells<sup><small><a href="#flash">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by SG. Replaces SG shells.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +20 ACC, -3 DMG taken (min. 0).</p>

<p>
	Do you like immortality?
	For a more defensive option, this ammo directly reduces the damage SGs take to a minimum of 0.
	Shield SGs (especially with M500) can normally last a while with the right setup, but this is still a massive upgrade for tanking.
	You should almost always be using these over any other ammo type.
	<!-- If you don't care for the knockback of Birdshell and want to take less damage, use this.
	Note that if you already are taking 1's and have shielding (from SAT8 or P22, for example), this won't do too much as your SGs will barely take any damage either way.
	These should make it possible to no-damage Pyxis waves in theater, which is nice. -->
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the damage reduction is treated as a skill effect.
Unsupplied shotguns won't benefit from it, so you don't get repair-free corpse dragging.</p>

<h2 id="flare">Signal Flare<sup><small><a href="#flare">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by HG/SMG. Replaces HP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: -1 ROF, +10% echelon ACC.</p>

<p>HP ammo won't magically transform non-damage dealing HGs/SMGs into DPS dolls.
This is fine to use on your non-DPS dolls, if you expect to face enemies with evasion and especially so when using RFHG echelons at night.
HP ammo is a very substantial damage increase for DPS dolls (Desert Eagle's FP improves by 34%, for example), so this doesn't replace HP ammo on damage dealers.</p>

<p>Be careful - if a fight needs massive amounts of accuracy buffs to work, you may be better of looking at surehit options instead.
Don't use this to try and fight Patrollers with regular ARSMG/RFHG teams. See also: <a href="criticalII.html#acc">the limited value of the Accuracy II talent</a> compared to Damage II, or <a href="evasion">this general summary of accuracy & evasion</a>.</p>

<p>
	To get a general sense of how much these do, here are some charts for the average DPS boost 1, 2, and 3 flares give you given your pre-flare accuracy (including base stat, equipment, tiles, fairy aura, and relevant skills):
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/newquip/flare-day.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>At day, it takes 3 flares to start getting a 5%+ DPS boost against normal evasions on ARs and RFs.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/newquip/flare-para-day.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>The 40% accuracy debuff from a SL10 para fairy makes these a bit more valuable, but nothing too dramatic yet.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/newquip/flare-night.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>At night, flares are awesome - even one flare is a 5%+ DPS boost against most targets, and getting three in a normal RFHG can up your rifle's DPS by ~15-20%.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Additional note: these make triggering Pekola almost free even if you lack a 5-star (Fervor) fairy.
</p>

<h2 id="speqs">SPEQ buffs<sup><small><a href="#speqs">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	To help a few dolls whose SPEQs got left in the dust by these new equipment pieces, some SPEQs have been adjusted.
	For the full list of changes:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WgQoKwU.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>
	The MG scopes are essentially enhanced RMRs, so VFLs are still better against 0 evasion.
	Otherwise, these will all generally be the best option for their respective doll.
