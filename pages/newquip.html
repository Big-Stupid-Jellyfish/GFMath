<p>Several new equipment pieces were recently announced on foreign servers.
There are some interesting ideas in them, but let's see if they are worth your time.</p>

<p>Important note: it may be quite a while before they are available to craft on EN. Don't get too excited. No date has been confirmed.</p>

<h2 id="rmr">RMR T4<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#rmr">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by HG/MG/AR-15/Sopmod. Replaces suppressor/scope.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +20 ACC, +30% crit chance.</p>

<p>For HGs: this is a straight upgrade over a typical suppressor (+10 EVA, +20% crit chance) for DPS/backline HGs, and a straight downgrade for frontline/tanking HGs as it gives no evasion.</p>

<p>For MGs: it depends on a few factors, namely your accuracy, enemy evasion, crit rate buffs, and crit damage.
I prefer to only use MGs against 0 EVA enemies, where the RMR T4 has no advantage over a crit scope.
For the sake of completeness, here are a few common scenarios with evasion:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/mgscope.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<center><em>Crossover chart for typical MG accuracy/evasion combinations. If your acc/eva combo is above the curve for your setup, use the RMR T4. If below, use a VFL.</em></center>

<p>Typical SF have ~15 evasion. Somewhat dodgy enemies can have 20-40 EVA, and Scouts are higher than almost everything with 80 EVA.
For some sample accuracies, at max level/100 affection, PKP has 33 acc, Negev 37, and Kord 24 (pierce mode).
In short: the RMR T4 is better than a critscope on most MGs against most evasive enemies in most setups.
Still, never try this at night.</p>

<p>For AR-15/Sopmod: it's much easier to get ARs to 100% crit rate with dolls like M4/UMP45.
	Consider using this if your team doesn't have crit rate sources.
	The RMR is somewhat less attractive on Sopmod as it doesn't help her grenade damage.</p>

<h2 id="2chip">#2 Chip<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#2chip">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by AR/SMG. Replaces T/X-Exoskeletons.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +15 FP, +25 ROF, -50% critical damage.</p>

<p>This is an interesting one, giving major FP/ROF bonuses in exchange for a <em>lot</em> of critical damage. Here are some general ideas to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Additive ROF/FP increases are more valuable when the base stat is low.</li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k74SCGGMHtwbl8gmTaETLsa8t12A7dWdj0V1tjdMD4Y/edit#gid=0">Frame breakpoints</a> will make the value of ROF vary.</li>
	<li>More FP = better DPS versus armor.</li>
	<li>More ROF = better Orthrus killing and better performance against large groups. Less useful against armor.</li>
	<li>ROF is effectively capped at 116, so +ROF will be less valuable if you have SMGs with strong ROF tiles like Vector/JS 9/SR-3MP or an AR that selfbuffs ROF.</li>
	<li>-50% crit damage is a big penalty for ARs - many typical formations get your ARs at or near 100% crit rate, and a command fairy can bring normal crit damage above 200%.</li>
	<li>With no or very little crit damage, EOTs/ITIs may be more viable scopes (even more so against highly evasive enemies).</li>
	<li>PEQs are generally mandatory at night making crits hard to benefit from.</li>
	<li>Some dolls (G41, Angelica, M4A1, 416, and Agent 416 come to mind) have SPEQs in this slot, making the comparison harder.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several hundred too many doll/fairy/equipment/enemy combinations to do some comprehensive general analysis.
For now, I'll put a few interesting results/charts below for your consideration.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="images/newquip/chip2.png">DPS improvement from #2 chip (EOT+Chip vs VFL+Exo) by AR base stats, no fairies/other dolls</a>.
		This doesn't account for ROF-buffing skills that would bring it over cap.
		The chart assumes no enemy evasion - higher values favor EOTs/ITIs more.
		Here, EOT+Chip is always a net DPS increase over VFL+Exo.
		You shouldn't seek out ARs specifically because of poor base stats - poor base stats are bad either way.
		However, the chip is more likely to be useful on ARs with low base stats than other equipment combinations.
		Note that the maximum/minimum values noted here occur at stat combinations no current AR possesses, as most will have some moderate balance of FP & ROF.</li>
		<li><a href="images/newquip/an94.png">Equipment options on AN-94</a> for a few different setups. Day/15 EVA/0 Armor in all cases.
		Sufficient crit damage buffs can make a crit scope+chip the best combination, <a href="images/newquip/an94scout.png">even against high evasion (here, 80 EVA)</a>.</li>
		<li>While the +ROF can be good, the ROF cap can be a major limitation on the chip's usefulness:
			<a href="images/newquip/t97.png">equipment comparison on Type 97</a>, and <a href="images/newquip/t9780.png">the same for 80 EVA</a>.
			Her near-permanent ROF-buffing skill puts her to 108 ROF, and it only takes 6 more points of base ROF ((72+6)*1.5=117) to pass the cap at 116.
			Interestingly, an ITI+Chip combination has potential at high enemy evasions when there are few to no crit bonuses.</li>
		<li><a href="images/newquip/val.png">Equipment options on AS Val</a>. EOTs have a relative disadvantage due to her perfect accuracy.</li>
		<li>On SMGs, it's a lot harder to compare as they have use for regular exoskeletons.
		If you already have tanking taken care of (Taunt/Twin/Shield fairy, for example), (1) consider using HGs instead for stronger buffs on your backline, and (2) this will almost always improve your SMG's DPS as they rarely crit anyways (ITIs/EOTs are almost always better than VFLs due to low base accuracy).</li>
		<li>Grenades cannot crit, so EOTs and chips are free damage.
		This doesn't mean grenadiers should <em>always</em> use an EOT+Chip as grenades have more potential to overkill on some enemies (thus not benefitting from the extra FP), but it makes it a lot more likely to be best.</li>
</ul>

<p>For ARs that can benefit from the chip, the main options are VFL+Chip vs EOT+Chip.
ITI+Chip <em>could</em> be good for some high-evasion scenarios, but it's best to just check the numbers for your specific case if there are that many scouts about.</p>

<p>For a few common setups and dolls, here's how they compare as a function of fairy crit damage aura:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/cdmg-basic.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Setting aside RFB as an outlier due to her SPEQ, VFL+Chip becomes favored over EOT+Chip anywhere between 10% fairy crit damage (AN-94) and 36% fairy crit damage (FNC, M82, and G11).
Increasing enemy evasion pushes these breakpoints further right as the accuracy from an EOT becomes better:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/cdmg-eva.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, crit rate tiles as gotten from M4A1 & UMP45 will push things in the other direction.
With both of them, all dolls checked will prefer a VFL for 25%+ fairy crit damage:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/cdmg-m445.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>The 23% ROF buff from C-MS+JS 9 puts almost everyone up to the ROF cap even with an EOT, which brings them all closer together in the 20-25% crossover range:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/cdmg-cs9.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>It may also be that some ARs would otherwise be dropped down a frame by an EOT, making it relatively worse.</p>

<p>For overall DPS optimization <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0FLOsxysAScY_ehWpf-vI8R2wohgxm8nqncXqZC2bQ/edit#gid=787582090">this spreadsheet</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c0JhaSX9WyL3EB-7RCDE4NrfzR1YuWdYWidQ_06-PrQ/edit#gid=1239433445">or this one</a>, both by mis, are probably the most comprehensive.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The #2 Chip is very strong and will see use in many ARSMG formations.
It is not always optimal - high ROF, crit rate, and crit damage may lessen its value.
It can reasonably be paired with both VFLs & EOTs, depending on the situation.
I recommend using <a href="https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html">a combat simulator</a> to check numbers for each specific team/enemy combination you are interested in.</p>

<p>At night, few ARs can get decent crit rates. There, the chip looks even better as long as it doesn't massively overcap ROF (see tables 3 (Artillery fairy) & 4 (command fairy) <a href="https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=micateam&no=1665096&exception_mode=recommend&page=1">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="slap">MK1000 SLAP Rounds<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#slap">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by MG. Replaces AP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +500 AP, -5 ROF.</p>

<p>ROF only has a minor effect on MG reload speed and doesn't change actual shooting speed.
Use this over standard AP ammo when enemy armor is greater than 195 (180 AP ammo + 15 base AP).
Applications are currently limited - few enemies have this much armor, and those that do go a bit above 200 are often best fought with RFHG echelons.
This has a bit more potential with Kord, who takes -50% AP in pierce mode.
Future (unreleased) enemies may also have even higher armor values.</p>

<h2 id="aps">M1022 AP Shell<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#aps">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by RF/MG. Replaces AP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +120 AP, +10 FP.</p>

<p>For enemy armor>AP, FP is largely interchangeable with AP.
Use if enemy armor is less than 145 (120 ammo + 15 base + 10 FP buff). High levels of FP buffing may slightly up this threshold.</p>

<p>Some mods have SPEQs that are a straight upgrade from this - KSVK & NTW have AP ammo that gives +180 AP/+10 FP, for example.</p>

<h2 id="bird">7.5 Birdshell<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#bird">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by SG. Replaces SG shells.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +12 ROF, +2 targets, -10% crit rate.</p>

<p>More targets means more potential knockback. The relative value of this compared to Buckshot (shoots the normal 3 targets/+15 FP/+22% crit damage) will likely vary per encounter.</p>

<h2 id="flash">SG Flashbang Ammo<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#flash">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by SG. Replaces SG shells.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +20 ACC, -3 DMG taken (min. 0).</p>

<p>For a more defensive option, this ammo directly reduces the damage SGs take.
If you don't care for the knockback of Birdshell and want to take less damage, use this.
Note that if you already are taking 1's and have shielding (from SAT8 or P22, for example), this won't do too much as your SGs will barely take any damage either way.
These should make it possible to no-damage Pyxis waves in theater, which is nice.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the damage reduction is treated as a skill effect.
Unsupplied shotguns won't benefit from the reduction, so you don't get repair-free corpse dragging.</p>

<h2 id="flare">Flare<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#flare">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by HG/SMG. Replaces HP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: -1 ROF, +10% echelon ACC.</p>

<p>HP ammo won't magically transform non-damage dealing HGs/SMGs into DPS dolls.
This is fine to use on your non-DPS dolls, if you expect to face enemies with evasion.
HP ammo is a very substantial damage increase for DPS dolls (Desert Eagle's FP improves by 34%, for example), so this doesn't replace HP ammo on damage dealers.</p>

<p>Be careful - if a fight needs massive amounts of accuracy buffs to work, you may be better of looking at surehit options instead.
Don't use this to try and fight Patrollers with regular ARSMG/RFHG teams. See also: <a href="criticalII.html#acc">the limited value of the Accuracy II talent</a> compared to Damage II.</p>
