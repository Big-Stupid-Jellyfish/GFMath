<!-- <p>Several new equipment pieces were recently announced on foreign servers.
There are some interesting ideas in them, but let's see if they are worth your time.</p>

<p>Important note: it may be quite a while before they are available to craft on EN. Don't get too excited. No date has been confirmed.</p> -->

<p>
	<em>(2021-12-14 update): Rather unexpectedly, these equipment pieces have been released on EN.
	A number of <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/443533099632951306/857458294863953930/2021-06-23_20_12_49.png">SPEQ balance adjustments</a> were also released accordingly.
	Good luck in your crafting.</em>
</p>

<p>
	Seven new equipment pieces have been introduced, with something to offer for every class.
	Let's go over them one-by-one and see if they are worth your resources.

<h2 id="rmr">RMR T4<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#rmr">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by HG/MG/AR-15/Sopmod. Replaces suppressor/scope.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +20 ACC, +30% crit chance.</p>

<p>For HGs: this is a straight upgrade over a typical suppressor (+10 EVA, +20% crit chance) for DPS/backline HGs, and a straight downgrade for frontline/tanking HGs as it gives no evasion.</p>

<p>For MGs: it depends on a few factors, namely your accuracy, enemy evasion, crit rate buffs, and crit damage.
I prefer to only use MGs against 0 EVA enemies, where the RMR T4 has no advantage over a crit scope.
For the sake of completeness, here are a few common scenarios with evasion:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/mgscope.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<center><em>Crossover chart for typical MG accuracy/evasion combinations. If your acc/eva combo is above the curve for your setup, use the RMR T4. If below, use a VFL.</em></center>

<p>Typical SF have ~15 evasion. Somewhat dodgy enemies can have 20-40 EVA, and Scouts are higher than almost everything with 80 EVA.
For some sample accuracies, at max level/100 affection, PKP has 33 acc, Negev 37, and Kord 24 (pierce mode).
In short: the RMR T4 is better than a critscope on most MGs against most evasive enemies in most setups.
Still, never try this at night.</p>

<p>For AR-15/Sopmod: it's much easier to get ARs to 100% crit rate with dolls like M4/UMP45.
	Consider using this if your team doesn't have crit rate sources.
	The RMR is somewhat less attractive on Sopmod as it doesn't help her grenade damage.</p>

<h2 id="2chip">#2 Chip<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#2chip">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by AR/SMG. Replaces T/X-Exoskeletons.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +15 FP, +25 ROF, -50% critical damage.</p>

<p>This is an interesting one, giving major FP/ROF bonuses in exchange for a <em>lot</em> of critical damage. For a full analysis, <strong>see <a href="chips">my writeup here</a>.</strong> A few basic things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chips, when paired with the right scope, are around a 25% DPS buff over classic VFL+Exo combinations. Don't pass these up. (ROF selfbuffers see much less benefit, if any.) </li>
	<li>At night you don't crit much anyways, making them even better picks (see tables 3 (Artillery fairy) & 4 (command fairy) <a href="https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=micateam&no=1665096&exception_mode=recommend&page=1">here</a>).</li>
	<li>Picking the right scope is rather complicated, and a <a href="https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html">damage simulator</a> will usually be your best bet.</li>
	<li>For a generic setups and a few common dolls, here's how an EOT and VFL compare as a function of fairy crit damage aura:</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/cdmg-basic.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>For overall DPS optimization <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M0FLOsxysAScY_ehWpf-vI8R2wohgxm8nqncXqZC2bQ/edit#gid=787582090">this spreadsheet</a>
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c0JhaSX9WyL3EB-7RCDE4NrfzR1YuWdYWidQ_06-PrQ/edit#gid=1239433445">or this one</a>, both by Mis, are probably the most comprehensive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The #2 Chip is very strong and will see use in many ARSMG formations.
	It is not always optimal - high ROF, crit rate, and crit damage may lessen its value.
	It can reasonably be paired with both VFLs & EOTs, depending on the situation.
</p>
<!-- I recommend using <a href="https://hycdes.com/pages/GFT_Echelon.html">a combat simulator</a> to check numbers for each specific team/enemy combination you are interested in. -->

<!-- <p>At night, few ARs can get decent crit rates. There, the chip looks even better as long as it doesn't massively overcap ROF.</p> -->

<h2 id="slap">MK1000 SLAP Rounds<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#slap">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by MG. Replaces AP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +500 AP, -5 ROF.</p>

<p>ROF only has a minor effect on MG reload speed and doesn't change their actual firing speed.
Use this over standard AP ammo when enemy armor is greater than 195 (180 AP ammo + 15 base AP).
Applications are currently limited - few enemies have this much armor, and those that do go a bit above 200 are often best fought with RFHG echelons.
This has a bit more potential with Kord, who takes -50% AP in pierce mode.
Future (unreleased) enemies will also have even higher armor values.</p>

<p>
	A few examples of how it affects reload speed:
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/slap.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<h2 id="aps">M1022 AP Shell<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#aps">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by RF/MG. Replaces AP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +120 AP, +10 FP.</p>

<p>For enemy armor>AP, FP is largely interchangeable with AP.
Use if enemy armor is less than 145 (120 ammo + 15 base + 10 FP buff), or a bit more if you have some FP buffs:</p>

<!-- Yes, armor overpenetration is a thing. 143 is technically a fine crossover, but you generally have FP buffs and 145 is easier to remember/hardly different. Similar deal with SLAP ammo. -->

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/newquip/sniperrounds.png" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>Some mods have SPEQs that are a straight upgrade from this - KSVK & NTW have AP ammo that gives +180 AP/+10 FP, for example.</p>



<h2 id="bird">7.5 Birdshell<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#bird">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by SG. Replaces SG shells.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +12 ROF, +2 targets, -10% crit rate.</p>

<p>More targets means more potential knockback. The relative value of this compared to Buckshot (shoots the normal 3 targets/+15 FP/+22% crit damage) will likely vary per encounter.</p>

<h2 id="flash">SG Flashbang Ammo<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#flash">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by SG. Replaces SG shells.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: +20 ACC, -3 DMG taken (min. 0).</p>

<p>
	Do you like immortality?
	For a more defensive option, this ammo directly reduces the damage SGs take to a minimum of 0.
	Shield SGs (especially with M500) can already last a while in the right fights, but this is still a major upgrade for tanking.
	<!-- If you don't care for the knockback of Birdshell and want to take less damage, use this.
	Note that if you already are taking 1's and have shielding (from SAT8 or P22, for example), this won't do too much as your SGs will barely take any damage either way.
	These should make it possible to no-damage Pyxis waves in theater, which is nice. -->
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the damage reduction is treated as a skill effect.
Unsupplied shotguns won't benefit from it, so you don't get repair-free corpse dragging.</p>

<h2 id="flare">Flare<sup><small><a href="newquip.html#flare">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>Equippable by HG/SMG. Replaces HP ammo.
Stats at maximum calibration/enhancement: -1 ROF, +10% echelon ACC.</p>

<p>HP ammo won't magically transform non-damage dealing HGs/SMGs into DPS dolls.
This is fine to use on your non-DPS dolls, if you expect to face enemies with evasion.
HP ammo is a very substantial damage increase for DPS dolls (Desert Eagle's FP improves by 34%, for example), so this doesn't replace HP ammo on damage dealers.</p>

<p>Be careful - if a fight needs massive amounts of accuracy buffs to work, you may be better of looking at surehit options instead.
Don't use this to try and fight Patrollers with regular ARSMG/RFHG teams. See also: <a href="criticalII.html#acc">the limited value of the Accuracy II talent</a> compared to Damage II.</p>
