	<h1>AR Damage over time - how good are the Type sisters?</h1>
</header>
			
				<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2020-November-07</em></center>
				<!-- <p>If you just want to see the plots, head over to <a href="">this album</a>.</p> -->

				<p>There are many self-buffing ARs in the game, with all sorts of combinations of stats, buffs, and cooldowns.
					The Type sisters (Type95 and Type97) stand out with their skills taking only <em>2 seconds</em> to activate and lasting for 15 after that.
					Most self-buffing ARs activate between 4 and 6 seconds, with skills usually lasting 5-10 seconds.</p>

				<p>But how valuable are these early activations? How much are the longer ICD dolls hurt by the delay?
					Today, we'll look at how some different ARs perform in cumulative damage dealt, relative to everyone's favorite standard, the G41 scale.</p>

				<p>She herself buffs damage by 75% with an ICD of 4s and a 10s duration, a very generic effect.
				By using this as a reference point, we can see the impact of other timings on damage output.</p>

				<span class="anchor" id="day"></span>
<h2>Daytime<sup><small><a href="g41-standard#day">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

				<div class="figure">
				<img src="images/g41-standard/plot-day.png" width="100%"/>
				</div>

				<p>Thanks to main character syndrome and a neural upgrade, ST AR-15 tops the charts for almost any time.
					Besides her, the type sisters quickly claim their lead after their skills activate, and hold it until 6-8 seconds when G41 catches back up.</p>

				<p>AN-94's passive isn't accounted for here, which will give her an edge early on and when her skill is on cooldown.
				This can up to double her DPS outside of her skill, and should be kept in mind for non-boss encounters.
				Note that her curve before 6 seconds is almost identical to AK-12's, and is hidden under it.</p>

				<p>FNC's 3 star statline and skill multiplier make it hard for her to keep up with the rest.</p>

				<!-- <p>EM-2's skill is a little tricky to include with how these are calculated. According to <a href="https://gfl.matsuda.tips/combatsim/">a simulator</a>, she maxes out at a 24.7% net increase 8 seconds in that quickly drops to 12.8% with G41's next shot and continues to fall from there (passing back below around 10.5 seconds).</p> -->

				<div class="figure">

				</div>

				<p>Here's some more ARs, still at day.
				Sopmod is charted without her grenade considered.
				That's a big omission, but it at least shows what her direct-fire DPS looks like.
				RFB's results look rather lackluster, but her backline targeting is often invaluable.
				G36 is mod3 with 2 dolls on her tiles. All relevant SPEQs are equipped and fully enhanced.
				Keep in mind that AUG/Angelica don't benefit as much from ROF buffs, so they will see slightly lower relative performance with tanks that buff ROF of your whole backline (UMP9, X95, etc).
				Other ROF buffers may bring themselves to or close to the ROF cap as well.</p>

				<span class="anchor" id="night"></span>
<h2>Nighttime<sup><small><a href="g41-standard#night">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

				<div class="figure">
				<img src="images/g41-standard/plot-night.png" width="100%"/>
				</div>

				<p>At night, dolls put on their PEQs, AN-94 is swapped out for Groza (OTs-14), and FNC for AS Val (mod3 w/ Fervor + Python skill2 uptime).
				Between dolls that went straight from a critscope to PEQ, little changes relative to each other.
				As the type sisters lose their SPEQ, they drop down a good amount.</p>

				<p>AR-15 gets a significant advantage as she keeps her critscope, and AK-12 goes down a little bit as her critical rate buff is less valuable.
				While Groza never beats out AR-15 here, keep in mind that this is considering a 0-armor target.
				If you want to know how armor changes matters, <a href="ar-night-armor">head on over here</a> for my analysis.
				As long as the fight goes past 6-7 seconds, she performs very well compared to the rest of the ARs here.</p>

				<p>Being able to equip a critscope at night is insane, especially for AS Val.
				To bring in some field examples, here's two runs against the low evasion dummy (~14-15 evasion) with AS Val and G41 buffed by Python:</p>

				<div class="figure">
				<img src="images/g41-standard/new-Para.png" width="49.8%"/> <img src="images/g41-standard/new-Warrior.png" width="49.8%"/>
				</div>
				<center>
					<em>
						Left: Fervor Parachute fairy, AS Val dealing 123% more damage. Right: Fervor Warrior (no skill), AS Val dealing 48% more damage. 100k dummy HP in both cases.
					</em>
				</center>

				The Para fairy and Python buffing crit chance/damage make AS Val even more impressive, considering her night damage is projected to be about 60% above G41's by the earlier plot 15 seconds in.
				On the other hand, she almost exactly matches up with the prediction with a Warrior fairy (50% net increase 20s in), where Python's crit tiles helping AS Val are likely offset by the accuracy aura boosting G41.

				<h2>Keep in mind...</h2>

				<p>Your dolls probably aren't in echelons all by themselves (unless it's some cheap farm route), so other skills and tilebuffs will change how things work out.
					Add a Fervor talent for even more fun.
				Some ARs will have better or worse tilebuffs themselves for your frontline.</p>

				<p>Enemy stats will also vary per encounter.</p>

				<p>When in doubt, you can always use <a href="https://gfl.matsuda.tips/combatsim/">a combat simulator</a> to get the specifics.</p>

				<p>These plots use the average total damage per time interval.
					Critical hits, different number of frames between attacks, accuracy rolls, and so on will make the percent difference vary per combat.
					The frame timings of each attack may also cause slight differences with simulators.
					Think of this as a more general average relationship.
				</p>

				<p>G41, TAR-21, and the type sisters (at day) have their SPEQs equipped and fully enhanced/calibrated in these charts. AR-15 uses her SPEQ+crit scope at day, PEQ+crit scope at night.</p>
