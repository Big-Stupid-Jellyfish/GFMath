<h1>Common Myths & Misconceptions</h1>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | Last updated 2021-07-09</em></center>

<p>Girls' Frontline is not exactly the most transparent game out there with regards to its mechanics.
There are few good ways to get information in-game, and players will often have to turn to guides and resources made by other players to figure out what's going on.</p>

<p>This page is a collection of some things I have heard in various communities that are inaccurate.
There may be <em>some</em> opinion here and there, but I will try to keep this as objective as possible.</p>

<h2 id="hr">There is a 3% minimum hit rate<sup><small><a href="#hr">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false.</p>

<p>There is no detectable minimum hit rate for either your own dolls or your enemies.
The general formula [hit rate = acc/(acc+eva)] works for any accuracy and any evasion.
10 base accuracy + night + no PEQ vs 210 evasion target dummy? Expect to hit 0.47% of your shots.
Bring surehit when fighting Patrollers, although with decent accuracy buffs most rifles would hit more than 3% of their shots anyways (but still not nearly enough to be practical).</p>

<p>See also: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/n9rsw4/weekly_commanders_lounge_may_11_2021/gyhr307/">a few tests/examples verifying this</a>. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tRFbSpN.png">Another example</a>.</p>

<p>Side note: HOCs actually do have a minimum hit rate. Their floor pre-rework was 30%, but EN started with reworked HOCs who among other changes got that bumped up to 40%.
This is only for lethality - pierce always applies, even if the target dodges.</p>

<h2 id="valmod">AS Val mod performs worse than Groza (OTs-14) if you don't have Python and a Fervor fairy<sup><small><a href="#valmod">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false.</p>

<p>Post-mod, of course. Pre-mod, AS Val has no redeeming features and will usually be outperformed by T65.</p>

<center>
<table style="width:60%">

</center>

<p>AS Val and OTs-14 have nearly identical stats - OTs-14 with marginally more FP, and AS Val with marginally more ROF.
If neither receive ROF buffs, this generally works out to a slight DPS edge in favor of AS Val if you give them both PEQs.</p>

<p>Beyond that, AS Val has a second skill. Without any special support, she gets 3 seconds of perfect accuracy on skill activation and at battle start (due to fairy talent).
Suppose a standard 15 evasion enemy. Without any other accuracy buffs, AS Val goes from a 78% to 100% hit rate any time she gets a FP buff, increasing her average DPS by over 20% during those periods.</p>

<p>What about high armor? I can assure you that a difference of 2 FP is not a significant benefit in favor OTs-14.
The following charts have both using PEQs:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/myths/val1.PNG" width="100%"/>
</div>
<center><em>Night/PEQs/0 evasion/160 armor/no fairies or other buffs</em></center>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/myths/val2.PNG" width="100%"/>
</div>
<center><em>Add 15 evasion, a supporting team, and a fairy. This is with a 140% net accuracy buff on AS Val, reducing the advantage from her second skill.</em></center>

<p>If both are oathed, the extra affection from mod3 makes it even less competitive. AS Val matches OTs-14's FP at 74 and is only 1 acc behind (59 vs 60).
Once you start being able to add in more FP buffs (mostly from Python), AS Val can equip her critscope and <a href="g41-standard#night">rocket even further ahead.</a>
In the meantime, she does very well once modded with a PEQ on.</p>

<p>OTs-14 is cheaper to raise with only one skill and no neural fragment costs making her a more attractive option to new players, but she's often less accessible (being a <a href="limited-dolls">limited event drop</a>) and is less useful long-term.
9A-91 and T65 are reasonable budget options if you are really concerned about cores.</p>

Personally, I don't think I've deployed either of my Grozas since Singularity.</p>

<h2 id="iws">IWS is best in exodia/specialized teams<sup><small><a href="#iws">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> mostly false.</p>

<p>IWS is a FP-buffing rifle with lower ROF than other rifles but high overall DPS due to a massive FP multiplier. Her skill uses slightly atypical targeting (each shot retargets to the current farthest enemy) and has 10/16 uptime instead of the 5/8 seen with most rifles.
This is not anything so abnormal that it requires a specific team composition to make use of.</p>

<p>IWS is perfectly serviceable in typical FP-based RFHG teams, with somewhat worse performance versus swarms/large groups but better performance versus smaller groups and tougher enemies.
The only reason I can think of to run IWS+4HG is to save resources on easy content, at which point you may as well use Hanyang+4HG/5HG/M4+2HG/4HG/1AR+1-3HG and so on.</p>

<p>Exodia-style formations also come with their own set of problems (link protection + evasion, to name a big one) and I would not recommend using them with any doll for most content.</p>

<h2 id="crit2">Critical II talent is good on Fury fairy<sup><small><a href="#crit2">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> for most people, false.</p>

<p>Do you have Jill? If you do, it is possible to build a team that makes use of a Crit II Fury fairy with her Bleeding Jane drink.
It almost certainly won't be critical for any content and has a number of limitations, but it's usable.
Otherwise, you'll almost always be better off with Damage I/II/Fervor.
Most echelons have very high or already maxed crit rates, making Critical II add very little actual DPS.
Fairies are expensive to raise, so getting a talent that only works in certain unusual scenarios is generally a bad idea.</p>

<p>Crit II may give decent numbers on MG echelons using crit scopes, but confining a fairy to a single echelon type is generally a bad idea.
It also has <a href="criticalII">potential use on a parachute fairy</a> for debuffed fights, but this is about using the talent on a Fury fairy.</p>

<p>The talent also is not necessary or important for Px4 Storm. A rifle with 88% crit rate, 100 FP, Px4 Storm tiles & skill, and a 5* Damage II command does (0.7*194*3.57)+(0.3*194)=543 average damage per shot.
Switching to a Critical II talent, the rifle would deal (1.0*169*3.57)=603 damage per shot.
A slight advantage, but this immediately disappears with any crit rate tiles or Fury's own skill and makes the talent near-useless in standard teams without Px4 Storm.</p>

<p>For a fairly mild example with crit rate tiles, adding 20% crit rate (as can be gotten from Desert Eagle, Python, Nagant revolver, and Contender; Five-Seven/PPK offer even more) changes the comparison to (0.84*194*3.57)+(0.16*194)=612 damage per shot with Damage II, already higher than the 603 damage/shot with Crit II.</p>

<p>This is also all ignoring Fury's active skill. At SL10, it boosts crit rate by 25% for the first 20 seconds, maxing out rifles and bringing ARs up to an 85% crit chance.
Critical II gives even less benefit there.</p>

<h2 id="rateup">Fairy rateup is nonexistant/a lie<sup><small><a href="#rateup">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false.</p>

<p>A reddit post from years ago claimed there was almost no change in the fairy rates during a general rateup.
I can't personally verify if the numbers were accurate at that time, but all rateups over at least the past ~2 years have seen significant rate increases.
I have a more in-depth comparison of rates for one rateup <a href="extras#fairycraft">here</a>, where the rates improved by 30-40% depending on recipe.
This isn't as much as the general T-doll rateup where many rates are doubled, but it's hardly something to pass on.</p>

<p>Either way, it's no excuse to stop crafting fairies.</p>

<h2 id="tilebug1">It's no longer possible to double-dip on Px4's skill by standing between her tiles<sup><small><a href="#tilebug1">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false (last checked 2021-06).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Id4oJT.png" width="50%"/>
</div>

<p>After kiting KSVK such that she was between tiles when Px4's skill activated, the bottom 3 screenshots show critical hits with damage numbers within the expected range for two stacks of Px4's skill, that would not be possible with only one stack.</p>

<h2 id="tilebug2">It's possible to double-dip on K5's skill by standing between her tiles<sup><small><a href="#tilebug2">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false (last checked 2021-06).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VdbE8ic.png" width="50%"/>
</div>

<p>These numbers don't account for the +2 damage from piercing armor, but that doesn't significantly change the range of damage values or the conclusion.
After a number of attempts I did not observe any numbers outside the expected range for one layer of K5's skill.</p>

<p>The inconsistency between this and Px4's skill is odd, but hey: it's Mica.</p>

<h2 id="mandatory">X is needed for Y<sup><small><a href="#mandatory">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> X is probably not needed for Y.</p>

<p>It is true that certain dolls and fairies can make your life a whole lot easier in certain circumstances.
However, there are often wide enough margins for success and enough alternative options that do similar things that no singular doll/fairy/piece of equipment is critical to win.</p>

<p>This can't be extended forever - if you insist on doing Theater's Core 8 with only 2* dolls, no fairies, AGS only, and no equipment: don't expect to accomplish much.
But as long as you're not intentionally crippling yourself and have some decent options available, there is probably a way.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beach Fairy, while very important, was not strictly necessary to kill deathstacks in Polarized Light ranking. Combo and Command were possible alternatives, and their downsides certainly wouldn't matter for any bracket below top 100.
    Landmine/Rocket/Suee/Construction fairies could be used to lower requirements even further.</li>
  <!-- <li>Using two Carcano M91/38s to drag 10-4E is cheap and easy, but M4+Calico+a FP HG could work full supply (with a decent fairy) and a few other rifles (NTW/IWS/R93) could also drag it (with a strong fairy).</li> [removed: 10-4E is rather irrelevant now] -->
  <li>416 mod is best for dragging 12-4E, but it can also be done decently by Uzi and K11. Depending on your tolerance for repairs, other grenadiers like M4 Sopmod II could be used. It's still <em>strongly</em> recommended to use 416 as one of your draggers as you'll save a significant amount on repairs.</li>
  <li>P22 is very well-rounded and a strong option for many teams, but there are always possible replacements depending on what you need.
    Px4 Storm will probably give better DPS, an SMG offtank may be better against swarms, Webley will do very well if the team depends on one rifle in particular, and backline HGs like C-93/HS2000/Desert Eagle may allow for more frontline HGs to cover everyone with their tiles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Girls' Frontline is not a game that requires players to follow an exact "meta" strategy to do well, but you still need to build functional echelons and adapt to the situation.
Better equipment, fairies, teambuilding skills, and kiting can help offset weaker areas.</p>

<h2 id="cap">A team is bad because of stat overcap<sup><small><a href="#cap">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> not necessarily (although it often is concerning).</p>

<p>Stat overcap does not make a team bad or good. It is something to keep in mind when building an echelon.</p>

<p>The most relevant stat that has a cap is ROF, where any points past 116 on non-MG/SG dolls have no effect.
Putting in too many ROF buffers can cause the stat to get boosted far higher than it needs to, wasting some or all the buffs.
Crit chance also stops at 100%, though having some extra can be nice if you're running Px4 Storm.</p>

<p>This sounds bad, but it's not always that simple.
Suppose there were arbitrarily many dolls with any possible fair combination of stats/tiles/skills you want.
In that case, a team that overcaps ROF could be improved by switching out a ROF buffer for an otherwise identical doll that trades just enough ROF to get under the cap for some other useful stat like FP.</p>

<p>This is not exactly the current state of the game.
It is entirely possible to have teams with not-100% "optimized" buffs that still perform useful functions better than many alternatives.
For example, if you need high uptime evasion and high-ROF ARs for a specific situation, you may end up wanting to use Angelica and C-MS.
The 5% ROF tile from C-MS is wasted on Angelica during her skill, but both dolls still perform important functions for the team and may not be easily replaceable.
JS 9 is perfectly usable in a team that has AR-15, even though AR-15 can cap ROF on her own and wouldn't benefit from JS 9's 18% ROF tile.
An efficient team is not necessarily an effective team.</p>

<p>ROF overcaps from HG skills may disappear before skills activate, when the HG skill is off cooldown, or if the HG/RF skills get out of sync.
Skill-based overcap won't last for 100% of the battle.</p>

<p>The crit rate boost from Five-Seven's active skill won't benefit rifles with gold VFLs that already have her tiles, but even without that she is still a very strong ROF buffer - her ROF+crit rate tiles are excellent, and the ROF multiplier from her skill (20%) is only slightly lower than standard 5* buff skills (25%).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/myths/overcap-fiveseven.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>(Note that in this sort of echelon, Stechkin mod may perform better than either, depending on how valuable the extra consistency from a 100% crit rate is. Both echelons are using a Command Fairy.)</p>

<p>That said, any <em>major</em> stat overcaps are very likely to be a problem.
Using 3 generic ROF handguns to buff WA2000+SVD is still bad, as there are other generic FP buffers on a similar level you could slot in to see a significant increase in damage at almost the same rate of fire.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/myths/overcap.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>Damage is technically capped, but link protection/overkilling would be a concern far before that (not to mention the contrived setups you'd have to use), so against swarms of weak enemies it is possible to stack excessive amounts of FP.
This is all of course dependent on which enemies specifically you're fighting.
Accuracy and evasion are not capped (<a href="#hr">nor is there a floor</a>), but it does have diminishing returns because of how the formula works.</p>

<h3>On the FP cap</h3>

<p>There is an incredibly impractical limit: a single bullet appears to be capped at 99,999 damage.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/myths/maxdamage.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>Much more relevant, however, is link protection.
In general, a single bullet can kill no more than one enemy link.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rN3HeaV.png">this enemy group</a> from 10-3N as an example.
Ignoring critical hits/damage variance/armor overpenetration, a doll with 3213 FP or more would always take away one link from any of the enemies shot, making further FP buffs pointless.
It would only take 803+ FP to oneshot each Vespid link.
This is still not a major concern - many newer mobs (Gunners, Zombies, and SWAP SF for example) can have thousands of HP/link.
It still can come up and is good to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Dinergates are probably the enemy that shows this limitation the most - even on 12-4E, they have around 100 HP/link but can come in massive packs.
It's trivial to get FP past that threshold, so after that you'd need AOE or ROF buffs to clear them faster.</p>

<h2 id="mp5">MP5 needs her night SPEQ to work<sup><small><a href="#mp5">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> it's good, but you shouldn't be scared away from using her without it.</p>

<p>To be clear: her night SPEQ is a straight upgrade over a regular T-Exo.
If you have it, there's no reason not to use it.
More evasion is good.
However, it's not critical to her functioning.</p>

<p>At max level/normal affection/SPP equipped, MP5 has 75+10+35=120 evasion with a T-Exo and 143 evasion with her SPEQ.
Let's take the Centaurus as an enemy example, as that's one area force shield SMGs are popular.
Centaurus have 51 accuracy in Theater 5/6's Core 8. MP5's dodge chance and effective HP with a few configurations is listed below, alongside G36c for comparison:</p>

<center>
<table style="width:100%">

</center>

<p>Other stuff, like the Orthrus that often accompany these archers, are a bit more accurate.
Here's the same table with 143 enemy accuracy.</p>

<!--
MP5 exo: 905 HP, 120 EVA
MP5 speq: 905 HP, 143 EVA
G63c: 1015 HP, 114 EVA
Thompson: 1190 HP, 104 EVA
-->

<p>So, while you could say that MP5 is the least durable force shielder without her SPEQ, it's a 10-20% difference compared to other force shielders, <15% compared with her SPEQ version.
Even with it, Thompson usually has a higher effective HP.
MP5's SPEQ is a substantial upgrade, but she has lots to offer even without it.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean Thompson is actually the best force shielder - this metric entirely neglects MP5's second skill, which will boost her survivability after her shield expires.
It's also worth keeping in mind tile differences - in a RFSMG echelon, MP5's tiles will significantly increase her value compared to other shield SMGs that only buff ARs.</p>

<p>
	I expect this would be a relatively minor effect, but it's also worth mentioning that shield HP (P22/HS2000/Shield fairy) helps dolls with higher evasion more.
	For example, Thompson would gain less effective HP than MP5 as she'll take more hits (and thus shield damage) on average from the same number of attacks.
</p>

<h2 id="hydras">Rifles need FP more than ROF buffs to kill Hydras/armored enemies<sup><small><a href="#hydras">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> decent AP is so close to (or past) enemy armor values and rifles have such high base FP that it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>A quick refresher on how armor works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enemy armor stat - AP = effective armor (min. 0)</li>
	<li>Post-buff damage * damage variance - effective armor = final damage (min. 1)</li>
	<li>There's a slight overpentration bonus: if AP>armor, final damage += min(AP-armor,2)</li>
	<li>Crit damage = final damage * critical damage multiplier</li>
	<li>Base AP of all dolls: 15</li>
</ul>
<p>Fully enhanced and calibrated gold ammo gives +180 AP. On top of the 15 AP all dolls start with, that's 195 armor gone.
Even without any buffs or fairies, rifles tend to have 120-170 base FP.
Hydras with their 199 armor are only blocking four points of damage, which is usually less than 3% of their FP.
Add on HG tiles/skills/fairy auras and armor is reducing their damage taken by less than 1% and is totally irrelevant.</p>

<p>Even more highly armored stuff like Uhlans (~226 armor) have nowhere near enough armor to be a concern.</p>

<p>In the pre-AP buff days (max 135 AP including base), people still dramatically overstated the importance of FP buffs.
Typical ROF-based RFHGs could handle Hydras just fine, and IWS was not a requirement at all.
You'd want at least some FP buffs, but that's true for any team.</p>

<p>While it's not actively <em>bad</em>, the additional AP from Springfield's special ammo does not provide a significant amount of value over other rifles with "just" 195 AP.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUHNbUeqX3M">a demonstration</a> of various ~200 armor enemies being killed without <em>any</em> AP ammo equipped, with a fairy FP buff equivalent to a ~3-star Artillery Fairy.</p>

<p>
	Ultimately, enemy armor is just not a relevant consideration when building high-end RFHG echelons.
	(This doesn't mean you should neglect AP ammo - it certainly makes things much easier. It's just that enemies don't suddenly become immortal because they have a few more points of armor than you can fully pierce.)
</p>

<h2 id="capes">Capes can be bad on RFs because of the MS penalty<sup><small><a href="#capes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> not really.</p>

<p>
	In approximate order of preference, here's a list of ways to deal with things that need movespeed on your DPS:
</p>
<ol>
	<li value="0">Use Calico mod (non-allied nodes). This will cover 99% of such cases.</li>
	<li>Reset until RNG targeting/AOE effects don't hit your rifles.</li>
	<li>Rebuild into a Hanyang mod exodia.</li>
	<li>Use a dupe Calico mod.</li>
	<li>Just move the rifles anyways as needed. Worked fine on many PL deathstacks (when slow field was active).</li>
	<li>Craft a 5* Combo and use it to kill the boss before their big attack.</li>
	<li>Put M500 mod or HS2000 by your rifles to protect them.</li>
	<li>Retreat your DPS, let SGs tank, and have your HOCs do the damage.</li>
	<li>Put another team with Auspicious fairy nearby and eat its peach.</li>
	<li>Use 5HG instead.</li>
	<li>Use ARHG instead.</li>
	<li>Use ARSMG instead.</li>
	<li>Just tank the extra damage and repair after.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	...
</p>
<ol>
	<li value="96">Use P30.</li>
	<li >Sacrifice ~17% DPS on your DPS units for a slight movespeed increase in that one fight.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Point is - rifles crit a lot, so capes are a massive damage buff.
	They are good to use in 99.9% of situations.
	Even if you really need movespeed on your rifles for some reason, there are other options that sacrifice less.
</p>

<h2 id="additive">X stacks additively<sup><small><a href="#additive">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> X probably stacks multiplicatively.</p>

<p>
	There are a lot of stacking buffs in this game, often from the same source (examples: Rico's passive, Fervor, Combo's active).
	While the skills generally don't specify, almost all of these effects stack multiplicatively:
</p>

	<li>Past 16 seconds, Fervor multiplies your FP by 1.1<sup>3</sup> for a 33.1% FP buff.</li>
	<li>With three stacks, Rico buffs her FP by 1.15<sup>3</sup> for a 52% buff.</li>
	<li>Two stacks of the SF Weaken chip reduce enemy FP to (1-0.12)<sup>2</sup>=77.44% of its base value.</li>
	<li>Multiple HG FP buff skills multiply.</li>
	<li>HG buff skills multiply with fairy talents and selfbuffs</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Exceptions are possible, but if you aren't sure it's much safer to assume it's multiplicative.
	The only thing that comes to my mind as additive are tiles, which are clearly written out on the formation screen anyways.
</p>

<p>
	Some things have even been commonly believed to be additive, only for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UApxdBOoc-Q">further testing</a> to reveal it was multiplicative.

<h2 id="dmgchart">This doll is doing more damage on the chart, so she's better<sup><small><a href="#dmgchart">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> it's possible, but it isn't conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>
	Some things about the in-game damage bar chart:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dolls can interact.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>One obvious case of this is with SL8. In normal RFHG echelons, she may appear to underperform by a little when compared to the other rifle.
			This is expected, and a good thing - her tiles give the other rifle an extra 10% damage, so they will do a bit more relative damage.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>It counts damage <em>inflicted</em>. A few implications of that:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>It may be underrepresenting contributions against enemies with high evasion/armor/force shields.</li>
		<li>Shooting partially wounded enemies will contribute less damage, but may give the same outcome as if shot order was flipped.
			Suppose you have a horde of 100 HP enemies, and two rifles that each deal 75 damage.
		One rifle hits the back enemy, leaving it at 25 HP (75 damage dealt).
		Immediately after, the second rifle shoots it, killing it (25 damage dealt).
		This pattern continues, with a 75/25% damage split.
		If the second rifle was the one to hit first, it would be a 25/75% split with the same overall outcome.
		They're contributing equally, perform equally, but one is displayed as being 3 times better than the other.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Battle conditions are very dynamic, so a snapshot at any given time doesn't say much about the whole battle or other battles.</li>
	<li>Not all damage is created equal - taking out some Doppels is much more important than cleaning up a few Strelets in front.
		On the other hand, chip damage against that same doppel is worthless if Grape snipes it shortly after.
	</li>
	<li>RNG. Damage variance, crits, accuracy, random targeting, kiting variations, and so on all contribute to making battle outcomes vary significantly.</li>
	<li>Differences may not be significant.
		Let's say your ARSMG runs into an easy mob fight.
		Uzi's initial grenade deletes nearly the whole thing, and she ends the fight with 60% of the damage done.
		This may make her appear strong, but if you even just removed Uzi without replacement, your ARs would still be strong enough to gun down everything a second later with no damage taken.
		Uzi claimed most of the damage done, but it didn't actually impact the fight outcome.
	</li>
	<li>
		Enemy shields and other weird mechanics (looking at you, Orthrus) aren't represented well.
		Ever seen NAN% damage when fighting a Patroller?
		Try plugging that into your comparison calculations.
	</li>
</ul>

<!-- <p>
	While not a trivial process, I recommend something along these lines to better test options:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Identify the options and the scope you wish to use them in.</li>
	<li>Find a few enemies you believe best represent this scope and save them to Target Saving</li>
	<li>With each option, battle these enemies several (5-20) times and record the battle results (time, damage taken, relevant damage contributions)</li>
	<li>Compare results between options, and pick the one that works best</li>
</ol> -->
