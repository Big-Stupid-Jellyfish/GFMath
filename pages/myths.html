<h1>Common Myths & Misconceptions</h1>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | Last updated 2021-07-09</em></center>

<p>Girls' Frontline is not exactly the most transparent game out there with regards to its mechanics.
There are few good ways to get information in-game, and players will often have to turn to guides and resources made by other players to figure out what's going on.</p>

<p>This page is a collection of some things I have heard that are inaccurate.
There may be <em>some</em> opinion here and there, but I will try to keep this as objective as possible.</p>

<h2 id="hr">There is a 3% minimum hit rate<sup><small><a href="myths.html#hr">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false.</p>

<p>There is no detectable minimum hit rate for either your own dolls or your enemies.
The general formula [hit rate = acc/(acc+eva)] works for any accuracy and any evasion.
10 base accuracy + night + no PEQ vs 210 evasion target dummy? Expect to hit 0.47% of your shots.
Bring surehit when fighting Patrollers.</p>

<h2 id="valmod">AS Val mod performs worse than Groza (OTs-14) if you don't have Python and a Fervor fairy<sup><small><a href="myths.html#valmod">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false.</p>

<p>Post-mod, of course. Pre-mod, AS Val has no redeeming features and will usually be outperformed by T65.</p>

<center>
<table style="width:60%">

</center>

<p>AS Val and OTs-14 have nearly identical stats - OTs-14 with marginally more FP, and AS Val with marginally more ROF.
If neither receive ROF buffs, this generally works out to a slight DPS edge in favor of AS Val if you give them both PEQs.</p>

<p>Beyond that, AS Val has a second skill. Without any special support, she gets 3 seconds of perfect accuracy on skill activation and at battle start (due to fairy talent).
Suppose a standard 15 evasion enemy. Without any other accuracy buffs, AS Val goes from a 78% to 100% hit rate any time she gets a FP buff, increasing her average DPS by over 20% during those periods.</p>

<p>What about high armor? I can assure you that a difference of 2 FP is not a significant benefit in favor OTs-14.
The following charts have both using PEQs:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/myths/val1.PNG" width="100%"/>
</div>
<center><em>Night/PEQs/0 evasion/160 armor/no fairies or other buffs</em></center>

<div class="figure">
<img src="images/myths/val2.PNG" width="100%"/>
</div>
<center><em>Add 15 evasion, a supporting team, and a fairy. This is with a 140% net accuracy buff on AS Val, reducing the advantage from her second skill.</em></center>

<p>If both are oathed, the extra affection from mod3 makes it even less competitive. AS Val matches OTs-14's FP at 74 and is only 1 acc behind (59 vs 60).
Once you start being able to add in more FP buffs (mostly from Python), AS Val can equip her critscope and <a href="g41-standard.html#night">rocket even further ahead.</a>
In the meantime, she does very well once modded with a PEQ on.</p>

<p>OTs-14 is cheaper to raise with only one skill and no neural fragment costs making her a more attractive option to new players, but she's often less accessible (being a limited event drop) and is less useful long-term.
9A-91 and T65 are reasonable budget options if you are really concerned about cores.</p>

Personally, I don't think I've deployed either of my Grozas since Singularity.</p>

<h2 id="iws">IWS is best in exodia/specialized teams<sup><small><a href="myths.html#iws">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> mostly false.</p>

<p>IWS is a FP-buffing rifle with lower ROF than other rifles but high overall DPS due to a massive FP multiplier. Her skill uses slightly atypical targeting (each shot retargets to the current farthest enemy) and has 10/16 uptime instead of the 5/8 seen with most rifles.
This is not anything so abnormal that it requires a specific team composition to make use of.</p>

<p>IWS is perfectly serviceable in typical FP-based RFHG teams, with somewhat worse performance versus swarms/large groups but better performance versus smaller groups and tougher enemies.
The only reason I can think of to run IWS+4HG is to save resources on easy content, at which point you may as well use Hanyang+4HG/5HG/M4+2HG/4HG/1AR+1-3HG and so on.</p>

<p>Exodia-style formations also come with their own set of problems (link protection + evasion, to name a big one) and I would not recommend using them with any doll for most content.</p>

<h2 id="crit2">Critical II talent is good on Fury fairy<sup><small><a href="myths.html#crit2">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> for most people, false.</p>

<p>Do you have Jill? If you do, it is possible to build a team that makes use of a Crit II Fury fairy with her Bleeding Jane drink.
It almost certainly won't be critical for any content, but it's usable.
Otherwise, you'll almost always be better off with Damage I/II/Fervor.</p>

<p>Crit II may give decent numbers on MG echelons using crit scopes, but confining a fairy to a single echelon type is generally a bad idea.
It also has <a href="criticalII.html">potential use on a parachute fairy</a> for debuffed fights, but this is about using the talent on a Fury fairy.</p>

<p>The talent also is not necessary or important for Px4 Storm. A rifle with 88% crit rate, 100 FP, Px4 Storm tiles & skill, and a 5* Damage II command does (0.7*194*3.57)+(0.3*194)=543 average damage per shot.
Switching to a Critical II talent, the rifle would deal (1.0*169*3.57)=603 damage per shot.
A slight advantage, but this immediately disappears with any crit rate tiles or Fury's own skill and makes the talent near-useless in standard teams without Px4 Storm.</p>

<p>For a fairly mild example with crit rate tiles, adding 20% crit rate (as can be gotten from Desert Eagle, Python, Nagant revolver, and Contender; Five-Seven/PPK offer even more) changes the comparison to (0.84*194*3.57)+(0.16*194)=612 damage per shot with Damage II, already higher than the 603 damage/shot with Crit II.</p>

<h2 id="rateup">Fairy rateup is nonexistant/a lie<sup><small><a href="myths.html#rateup">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false.</p>

<p>A reddit post from years ago claimed there was almost no change in the fairy rates during a general rateup.
I can't personally verify if the numbers were accurate at that time, but all rateups over at least the past ~2 years have seen significant rate increases.
I have a more in-depth comparison of rates for one rateup <a href="extras.html#fairycraft">here</a>, where the rates improved by 30-40% depending on recipe.
This isn't as much as the general T-doll rateup where many rates are doubled, but it's hardly something to pass on.</p>

<p>Either way, it's no excuse to stop crafting fairies.</p>

<h2 id="tilebug1">It's no longer possible to double-dip on Px4's skill by standing between her tiles<sup><small><a href="myths.html#tilebug1">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false (last checked 2021-06).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Id4oJT.png" width="50%"/>
</div>

<p>After kiting KSVK such that she was between tiles when Px4's skill activated, the bottom 3 screenshots show critical hits with damage numbers within the expected range for two stacks of Px4's skill, that would not be possible with only one stack.</p>

<h2 id="tilebug2">It's possible to double-dip on K5's skill by standing between her tiles<sup><small><a href="myths.html#tilebug2">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> false (last checked 2021-06).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VdbE8ic.png" width="50%"/>
</div>

<p>These numbers don't account for the +2 damage from piercing armor, but that doesn't significantly change the range of damage values or the conclusion.
After a number of attempts I did not observe any numbers outside the expected range for one layer of K5's skill.</p>

<p>The inconsistency between this and Px4's skill is odd, but hey: it's Mica.</p>
