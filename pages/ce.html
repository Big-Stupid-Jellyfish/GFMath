	<h1>Combat Effectiveness</h1>
</header>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2021-July-22 | Last updated 2022-March-06</em></center>

<p>
	Combat Effectiveness, or CE, is a number the game assigns to your dolls, echelons, and enemies.
	It is intended to provide an easy-to-understand evaluation of both your team's strength and the danger posed by enemies.
</p>

<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/ce/ce.jpg" width="80%"/>
</div>
</center>
<center><em>If you've played this game for more than a minute, you should have seen this plenty of times.
Just in case though, you can see the CE of the echelon (top right) and of each doll (bottom).</em></center>

<p>
	On an individual level, CE is calculated from the doll's stats, rarity, and skill level.
	The exact formulas have been datamined by <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/kqtpcv/weekly_commanders_lounge_january_05_2021/gifxq8v/">/u/elgatoroid here</a>.
	Echelon CE takes into account tiles and fairy aura, but not fairy talent or fairy skill level (example: <a href="images/ce/talent-skill.jpg">a SL10 Crit II Fury fairy vs a SL4 Fervor Fury fairy</a>).
</p>

</ul>

<span class="anchor" id="use"></span>
<h2>Value of CE<sup><small><a href="#use">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>
	At first glance, CE may look like a reasonably useful number to keep in mind.
	Compared to a rifle with 100 FP, another rifle otherwise the same but with 120 FP will have a higher CE and be objectively better.
	An ARSMG echelon with gold equipment and a high rarity fairy will have more CE than one with green equipment and no fairy.
</p>

<p>
	However, because of how teambuilding and combat works in this game, combat effectiveness is a very unreliable metric that only really serves to tell you how many points you get for killing each enemy in ranking maps and give a very rough idea of how developed your echelon is (levels/equipment/fairy).
	It should not inform any teambuilding or combat-related decisions.
</p>

<p>
	One core part of teambuilding is counter-picking.
	Especially as you get farther into the game, enemies will have very significant strengths and weaknesses.
	Building custom echelons that can exploit these weaknesses and protect against their strengths will perform far better than random or generic setups.
</p>

<!--
<p>Much of a doll's strength comes from their skill.
There typically aren't massive differences in base stats, and the tiles on DPS dolls usually won't have a major impact.
CE, however, only factors in the skill level of each doll without regard to its contents.
In other words, a doll at SL5  that increases their damage by 500% would be valued less than a doll at SL10 that increases their damage by 25%, all else equal.
Beyond that, the value provided by any given skill will vary tremendously by circumstance.
Molotov and grenade skills are strong against dense enemy groups but nearly useless against bosses.
M200's perfect accuracy is great against high-evasion enemies at night but is rather disappointing against most daytime enemies.
The shields HS2000 gives to your backline won't do much, until a Doppelsoldner triggers its field-wide barrage.</p> -->

<p>
	Skills are also one of the most important aspects of each doll.
	They can be incredibly useful and perform critical functions in certain fights, but the CE formula neglects to account for anything beyond the raw skill level.
	Carcano M91/38's skill is rated the same as WA2000's and M200's skills, despite their drastically different roles and effects.
</p>

<p>
	In terms of evaluating enemy difficulty, here are some examples of where this can go very wrong:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>250k CE Uhlans were highly desirable spawns late in Isomer - not only did they give a ton of points, but they were simple if you had a Taunt/Twin fairy.</li>
	<li>300k deathstacks in Polarized Light could be killed at full health by: Kord-based gunboats, Hanyang-based RFHG echelons, and a few other specific RFHG teams if your kiting was incredible.
	All these teams were in the 50-60k CE range.
	A 70-80k ARSMG/MGSG echelon would have no hope without the use of EMPs/Goliath bombs.</li>
	<li>A lone lv90/x5 MG (~3k CE) can solo the 65x Tarantula swarms in 8-1N, as can a level 60/x1 Zas with a few FP buffs (~200 CE).
	On the other hand, most RFHG echelons (30-60k CE) would be quickly overwhelmed by the same enemies due to their low ROF and backline targeting.</li>
	<li>Guard/Jaeger groups are harder for ARSMG echelons - the Guards can take a while to work through, while the Jaegers can rip apart your SMGs.
	RFHG echelons can take out the Jaegers immediately and deal with the less threatening Guards after.</li>
	<li>Shotguns with sufficient armor for the enemy you're up against are nearly immortal, but add on a few more points of damage and they'll fall apart like wet paper.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Some enemies like Brutes come with armor piercing, and are nearly harmless to SMGs but deadly to SGs.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Armor is no problem if you have armor piercing, but heavily armored enemies like Hydras and Uhlans quickly become unkillable against an echelon without AP.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	To know what to expect in each battle, you're better off <a href="https://pengupengupengu.github.io/gflmaps/">looking up the enemy stats here</a> and practicing against each enemy type to learn their mechanics and quirks.
	CE may give you a rough idea of how developed a team is (levels, links, equipment, fairies).
	But you can also get a more precise measure of that by looking at their levels/links/equipment/fairy.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="stack"></span>
<h2>CE Stacking<sup><small><a href="#stack">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>
	A while back, if you wanted loads of friend points, you could get massive CE numbers from a 3MG2SG armorstack echelon.
	With a 5* Armor Fairy and everything else maxed, you could get up to <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/532176803364601866/803740280762138634/Screenshot_20210108_165221_com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en.jpg">~112k CE</a>.
	This was changed on 2020-04-21, when the CE value of armor past a certain threshold was dramatically reduced.
</p>

<p>
	This was almost certainly because of the introduction of RPK-16 on foreign servers: she allowed players to use 4 MGs with armor tiles and could take KSG past some threshold where CE values <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/410790982116966400/862819832461656084/Screenshot_20200116-121044__01.png">ballooned to 350k+</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Before (left) and after the change (right):
</p>

	<div class="figure">
		<img src="images/ce/armor-old.jpg" width="49%"/>
		<img src="images/ce/armor-new.jpg" width="49%"/>
	</div>
</center>

<p>
	70k CE isn't exactly bad, but the change allowed for other team compositions to compete with MGSG for the top of your friend list.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="newquip">new equipment pieces released</a> allow for new levels of CE stacking.
	MGSG with SLAP ammo seems to be the best at the moment:
	<!-- I don't yet know the maximum, but here's one example to give a general sense of what you can do: -->
	
</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/ce-104885.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
</center>
<p>
	That's Yurine, Negev, Lewis, RPK-16, and LTLX7000.
	<!-- comp from gfen at 104670 CE, fixed equips (ITI -> VFL on LTLX) to get this at 104885 -->
</p>
<p>
	The previous maximum was a bizarre UMP40-based crit-stacking team, at 80894 CE:
</p>

<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/ump40-redux.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<!-- <p>
	The following KSVK/NTW RFHG echelon also does extremely well. You may still be able to break 80k without one or two HG oaths.
</p>

<div class="figure">
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gri1E7l.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>
	Formation is an (un)holy cross. I strongly advise against using this echelon or a variant for real content.
</p>

<p>
	A few other configurations that give pretty big numbers (but are not necessarily the best): <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6cb4Hwq.png">72867 with ARSMG</a> (70k+ possible without oaths on SMGs), <a href="https://i.imgur.com/asU43HB.png">76736 with 2SG3MG armorstack</a>, and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CyBqyI6.png">70877 with 1SG4MG armorstack</a>.
	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/7BybpzM.jpg">Welrod's mod</a> can go even higher, although other new dolls may give even better numbers by the time she makes it to EN. -->
	<!-- <a href="newquip#slap">SLAP ammo</a> gives lots of CE when that gets to EN eventually: -->
<p>
	 With some future mods, here's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LfvNmCV.png">a 110982-CE 5MG SLAP stack</a> by /u/UnironicWeeaboo.
	 For a surprisingly normal formation, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WAPWmv6.png">here's an ARSMG with 88006 CE</a>.
</p>

<!-- <p>
	For the very top CEs, you'll have to look to SF echelons: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vMgy7b8.png">here's 103262 CE with Dreamer</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3pWAnm1.png">91240 CE with Scarecrow</a>. 
	(<a href="https://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=micateam&no=1658162">Source</a>, and as these were built for ranking you can stack even higher.)
	The highest CE I know of on EN using SF is 110000 with Hunter+5 Jaegers+3 Dinergates:
</p>

<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/sfce.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>
-->
<!-- F for our F2P friends -->
<p>
	<!-- In the future, SWAP Prowlers are nice (as above that's 3 Dinergates hidden behind the "in combat" signs): -->
	For the very top CEs, you'll have to look to SF echelons:
</p>

<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/future-sf.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>
	The "in combat" signs to the right are covering 3 Dinergates.
</p>
<p>
	See also: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7rnR5iF.png">another almost-as-good variant</a>.
	Warning: actually building this team may require funding an additional anime season.
	Only recommended for CEOs and early bitcoin investors.
</p>

<p>
	An older SF stack with an unusually round number:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/sfce.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<!-- And even then why not just buy a gaming PC or something. -->

<!-- As always future content releases may change what's best. -->
<!-- Not all possible SF variations have been tested. This *should* be the best assuming ringleader tiles aren't a big deal, but that could be a bit of a stretch. -->

<p>
	Keep in mind that this number has very little to do with real combat performance.
	Please do not copy anything here when trying to build an effective team - think of it purely as an amusing exercise in "how big can I make this random number."
</p>

<p>
	Theater CE stacking is an entirely different matter.
	It's not worth it and the best strategies vary by boss.
	If you really want to, I recommend finding someone else's setup to copy for each boss.
	Keep in mind that you will almost certainly be better off not stacking and instead making backup teams/an echelon for advantaged dolls.
	For example: I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8EQs89zdxZ-roewZGgJEb3W8D3p4Jzx">played through Theater 4 on a low-spec account</a> (2-3* fairies, ~2.5 functional echelons, level 60 HOCs, etc).
	Being able to clear the best zones each day and having (near) the full 24% advantaged bonus was sufficient to end up with a 5% overall ranking, even after a horrific voting record.
	Doing the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8EQs89zdxZRFUgVJM95s1MbHkpYn9AE">in Theater 5</a> was enough for the top 4%, voting all B.</p>

<p>
	If you want to make a useful friend echelon, I would go with one of these templates:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Destroyer/Architect/SF HOC support.</strong> With the release of Destroyer, there's now a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZecHm-niQtQ">decent way of leveling SF units</a> that doesn't cost resources/CRs.
	Fighting Spirit & Weaken are the recommended chips (<a href="8-2">Weaken especially helps with the armor requirements</a>).</li>
	<li>Boss-oriented ARSMG, for people who don't want to kill 7-6 Dreamer with their own teams for the HOC daily as well as new players trying to clear early story chapters.</li>
	<li>Generalist RFHG, optional Grape - for people trying to clear chapters 11/12.</li>
	<li>Anti-Judge 2SG/2-3MG/0-1HG echelon - for people struggling to kill Judge. Desired armor: 29 for 9-6, 41 for 9-4E, 54 for 9-4N, 49 for 10-6, 57 for Isomer EX (campaign).</li>
	<li>Waifu team. Good equipment & a 5* fairy will allow most echelons to clear most content people need a friend echelon for, so why not flex your favorite oath at the same time?</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Friend echelons can move around at night fine without a handgun, but I recommend including at least one anyways so it provides vision to nearby nodes.
	Fairy skills aren't activated so just go with whatever gives the best stats (usually Command).
</p>

<p>
	After setting a friend echelon, its CE is never checked or recalculated.
	You may see some players who still have a 2SG3MG 90k+ CE echelon - they simply set it before the nerf in 2020 and haven't updated the team.
	Never trust friend echelons to be a good source of teambuilding advice.
	They very likely contain waifu/CE stack elements, neither of which contribute to real combat performance.
</p>

<!-- Also most people who play this game are bad at it. Especially when it comes to teambuilding. -->

<p>
	Oaths are not strictly necessary for high CE - doll stats, tiles, equipment, and fairies make a much bigger difference.
	I use fully oathed teams to show the expected upper limits of each echelon type, but you can still get 70k+ CE with no oaths and no 5* Parachute fairy (Command's aura is strictly worse than Para's, but is still very good for CE).
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="analysis"></span>
<h2>Analysis of Echelon Data<sup><small><a href="#analysis">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>
	You may have noticed the red exclamation mark in the first image here or seen it yourself in your own teams.
	Clicking that CE display will bring up a window analyzing your echelon and offering suggestions:
</p>

<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/analysis.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<center><em>One of the more common messages you'll see. No matter how much it insists, not every echelon needs a handgun.</em></center>

<p>
	There are some beginner mistakes that this system will properly identify and warn about, but once you understand the very basic fundamentals of teambuilding it will have nothing of value (and even then, it can give bad advice a new player won't be able to identify).
	It encounters many of the same pitfalls as CE, and splitting the metric into a few categories isn't enough.
</p>

<p>
	Here's one interesting case with the echelon I've been using for Neural Fragments:
</p>

<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/survivability.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>
	With no equipment on P22, it says the echelon has insufficient survivability.
	Maybe it wouldn't do well against Judge, but for regular combat it has everything - one shotgun, high armor (55 before any Fairy skill/talent), and two shield skills.
	Equipping an X-Exo on P22 will make it switch to complaining about equipment, which seems to be its fallback if it finds nothing else to say.
</p>

<p>
	It also doesn't like RFHG echelons for similar reasons:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/survivability2.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>
	This is somehow considered a "proper" formation:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/formation.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>
	And it rates a SL1 PzB39 (arguably the worst rifle in the game) the same as a SL5 Gr G28 (a respectable FP buffer) in terms of DPS:
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="images/ce/pzb.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>

<p>
	I could go on with other examples, but these should get the point across.
	The analysis of echelon data does not give you useful information, and if its advice happens to be correct, it just got lucky.
