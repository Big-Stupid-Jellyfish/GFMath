# GFMath: Daytime AR equipment comparison

For the plots alone, see https://imgur.com/a/OmZbYV3

Setting aside special equipment and dolls with unusual slots (AR-15, for example), the standard equipment set for day ARs is a gold crit scope, HV ammo, and optional X-exo. The case for HV ammo and X-exos are trivial to make (being the only in-slot equipment to improve or not reduce damage), but crit scopes do have a few competitors that almost never get mentioned. Night battles are going to be ignored here as you basically always use a PEQ there.

So, how much of a difference is there between these scopes? Is it ever worth using an EOT or ITI on an AR?

For reference:

* VFL = VFL 6-24x56, aka crit scope or telescopic sight. Provides +48% critical hit chance at max calibration and enhancement.
* EOT = EOT 518, aka holo sight. Provides +14 accuracy, +8 damage, and -4 rate of fire.
* ITI = ITI Mars, aka red dot sight. Provides +30 accuracy and -1 rate of fire.

Green equipment has their own name set (PSO-1, EOT 516, COG M150 for these scope types, respectively). The impact of the rate of fire penalty will vary per AR based on what breakpoints are near their default ROF and other buffs they may have.

Fairies used are assumed to be at 5* with the Damage 1 talent. G41 stars in all these comparisons as the “standard” AR.

## Optimizing against Evasion

Most enemies’ stats, including evasion, can be viewed on https://gf.hometehomete.com/en/maps/ by mission. Typical SF mobs have 12-16 evasion, with scouts sitting around 80. SF bosses are usually between 30 and 60 evasion.

On her own, G41 with a crit scope maintains a solid lead until just before 60 evasion, where the accuracy bonus of an ITI becomes worthwhile. Adding UMP45+M4A1 pushes this crossover point past 100 evasion due to the crit rate bonus being more valuable with a crit scope. In either case, an EOT seems to provide no unique value at low, moderate, or high enemy evasion.
