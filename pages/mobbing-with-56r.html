	<li>The crit damage stacks up to 40% against single-linked enemies. This bonus does not require them to have damaged/missing links, and is calculated as <code>(5-x)*10%</code> for <code>x</code> current links.</li>
	<li>As seen with <a href="svch">SVCh</a>, multiplied = doubled.</li>

	Released alongside Mirror Stage, Type56R has rather obvious use against bosses and other single-linked threats like Doppelsoldners, Uhlans, and Minotaurus.
	How much her skill 2 helps against mob-type groups filled with 5-linked enemies is less clear.
	Let's run some tests to see if she holds up as a solid generalist or if she should be kept in reserve for specific scenarios.
</p>
<span class="anchor" id="mobbing"></span>
<h2>Mobbing<sup><small><a href="#mobbing">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Note that, to be as fair as possible given my account, I'll only be testing my oathed rifles.
	This gives modded rifles a slight edge when compared to purely non-oath performance, due to their increased affection cap.
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/mobbing-with-56r/56r1.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	Not a good start - Type56R lagged behind by every metric.
	She was also the only one to consistently contribute less damage than the fixed rifle - Rico, in this case.
	While Type88 rather obviously blew past the others, R93/M14/WA2000 all had a solid advantage.
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/mobbing-with-56r/56r2.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	This node posed a problem for Type56R - the more dangerous Nemeums are 4-linked, while the SWAP Aegis have 2-3 links.
	Other rifles focus the Nemeums better, reducing damage taken.
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/mobbing-with-56r/56r5.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em>No flash shells and slightly insufficient armor stacking so we can estimate the number of shots taken.</em></center>
<p>
	This one is a bit less depressing, but she still only about ties with M14.
	R93 has a solid advantage.
</p>
<span class="anchor" id="bossing"></span>
<h2>Single target, single link<sup><small><a href="#bossing">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<h3>Bosses</h3>
<p>
	Let's also take a moment to check on her specialty.
	First, let's see her in-skill DPS vs R93 (para fairy, 15 EVA, no HGs):
</p>

	<table style="width:auto;">
		<tr>
			<th>Doll</th>
			<th>0 stacks</th>
			<th>1 stack</th>
			<th>2 stacks</th>

<p>
	Type56R doesn't look that crazy here, and while her passive doesn't need to build up, they both get full uptime soon enough.
	M14 mod would have 2695 DPS under the same conditions, but with 5/8 uptime (~2300 uptime-averaged DPS).
	We can see a similar result by taking a standard RFHG against a dummy for 300 seconds:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/mobbing-with-56r/vsr93.png" width="49%"/>
	<img src="images/mobbing-with-56r/vsm14.png" width="49%"/>
</div><em>Left: Type56R performs ~7% worse than R93. Right: Type56R and M14 are about equal here.</em></center>
<p>
	As all rifles are oathed, Type56R and M14 have a ~5% built-in mod affection advantage.
	I'm assuming a low-armor enemy, so Type56R will gain some ground against higher armor enemies like Doppels/Uhlans due to her SPEQ.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="images/mobbing-with-56r/vsmore.png">Another example with less HGs and more rifles.</a> Other rifles using AP ammo, so Type56R's SPEQ boosts her a bit. WA2000 with MS SPEQ.
	R93 has a slight edge (~6%) over Type56R, though both have a solid lead over M14/WA2000.

<p>
	Naturally, Grape is overpowered against enemies that seem like they should be elite but aren't.
	Type56R also did well, and was a bit more consistent in taking out a Gladiator before its slam than the typical selfbuffers.
</p>
<p>
	HS.50 was helpful in taking out the gladiators early, but needed to reload shortly after leaving the gunners for Kar.
	This echelon wastes a fair amount of ROF on HS.50 and wasn't built with her in mind, so that's to be expected.
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/mobbing-with-56r/56r4.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	Type56R is also quite effective against some of the "fun" new Paradeus enemies.
	Here, she was able to kill the Visjnoe before its buff removal.
	Other selfbuffers were not fast enough and suffered greatly.
</p>
<p>
	Turning autoskill off until the cleanse passes helped slightly with R93, but the fight remained painful.
</p>
<span class="anchor" id="conclusion"></span>
<h2>Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Type56R's performance was a bit disappointing, honestly.
	The usual community opinion seems to be that she's a top-tier generalist rifle, but that has only held in bossing/single-link scenarios.
	If her targeting isn't providing some specific function, I'd be inclined to pick one of the usual generalists instead.
</p>
<p>
	But, against bosses and various single-linked threats, Type56R is an excellent rifle.
	Her DPS is competitive with R93, and she's even better when you want something picked off quickly.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="notes"></span>
<h2>Notes<sup><small><a href="#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Type56R's first shot does double damage, making her nice for certain <a href="datasim">Data Sampling formations</a>.</li>
	<li>If you like to micro, you may be able to boost her a bit more with some well-timed wiggles. Other kiting requirements, user error, and such make this hard to quantify but it is an option.</li>
	<li>She prioritizes enemies with less links, which could be a good thing (against a Doppel hidden among Strelets) or a bad thing (trying to take out some Cerynitis behind a Minotaurus to keep your Taunt alive).</li>
	<li>As always, rifle tile differences introduce some minor variance in the test results.</li>
</ul>
