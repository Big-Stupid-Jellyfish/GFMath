<h1>Core Rates: additional notes</h1>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | Last updated 2021-October-17</em></center>

<p>
	This page contains some extra commentary on <a href="core-rates">core rates</a> that are less relevant/interesting to most players.
</p>

<p>
	My personal data is a bit rough (just going by what's in rescued_doll.csv) and has a few issues:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		I <em>very</em> rarely use Rescue Fairy (SL5).
		This may slightly increase the core rate on some maps.
	</li>
	<li>
		Runs may very rarely fail or be cancelled partway through.
		This may slightly decrease the core rate.
		11-6 is most vulnerable to this, as I've tried a few Rescue setups that ultimately didn't pan out there.
	</li>
	<li>
		Some runs do not have the "mission attempt" recorded.
		These are excluded as I get the number of runs by counting the number of unique mission attempts.
		<!-- Not all my runs are recorded, but that shouldn't change drop rates in the ones that are. -->
	</li>
	<li>
		If no dolls drop at all, the run won't be counted.
		This should be an exceptionally rare occurrence, however.
		(Example: if the chance for each node & mission clear is equal and 12-4E drops 4.4 dolls/attempt (of 5 checks), the probability of failing all 5 checks in a row is 0.002%. If any specific drop is guaranteed this can't happen.)
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	With any luck these factors are minor enough to not have a significant effect and maybe even cancel each other out.
	But don't take these numbers as exact to the twentieth decimal place or anything.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect some incorrect claims on core rates come from a problematic assumption in analyzing collected data - namely that there is a set number of drops per run.
	Many enemies don't always drop something, so using the number of drops to calculate core rate will be a bit off. Some examples based on my own data:
</p>
<center>
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<th>Map</th>
<th>Total cores</th>
<th>Total runs</th>
<th>Total drops</th>
<th>Drops/run</th>
<th>Cores/run</th>
<th>Cores/5 drops</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11-5</td>
<td>554</td>
<td>1469</td>
<td>5035</td>
<td>3.43</td>
<td>0.38</td>
<td>0.55</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12-4E</td>
<td>8484</td>
<td>9465</td>
<td>41689</td>
<td>4.40</td>
<td>0.90</td>
<td>1.02</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p>
	Dividing the cores in my data by (total drops/5) on 11-5 matches up with one core rate figure I've heard but overstates the true core rate by 40-50% as it seems the enemies there have a relatively low chance of dropping anything.
	I've also heard 1-1.2 commonly cited as the core rate on 12-4E, and assuming 5 drops/run gives a number closer to that.
</p>
<p>
	You can verify this for yourself - try counting the number of dolls you have after a few runs of 12-4E.
	Sometimes you'll gain 4 dolls, other times you'll gain 5.
