<h1>Protocol Assimilation Resource Statistics</h1>
<!-- <center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2021-January-08</em></center> -->
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | Last updated 2021-November-12</em></center>

<p><em>Disclaimer: numbers presented here are the result of my own data records.
They are only an estimation of the actual rates, and individual luck will vary.
Statistics here are aggregated from several different accounts to improve accuracy, and so far there does not appear to be any per-account variation in rates outside of what normal luck would explain.</em>

<h2 id="size">Coalition Unit size distribution<sup><small><a href="#size">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>SF unit sizes are not uniformly distributed, and instead follow a bell-shaped curve.
Below are the frequencies of each size from my pulls:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4DprpDP.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Assuming equal odds for L/S and XL/XS, I would estimate the true odds to be something like:</p>
<center>
<table style="width:80%">
	<tr>
		<th>Size</th>
		<th>Estimated Rate</th>
		<th>Lower bound</th>
		<th>Upper bound</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Medium</td>
		<td>60%</td>
		<td>56.88%</td>
		<td>62.69%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Large/Small</td>
		<td>17.5%</td>
		<td>15.91%</td>
		<td>18.73%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Extra Large/Extra Small</td>
		<td>2.5%</td>
		<td>1.12%</td>
		<td>2.71%</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Upper and lower bounds are listed with 95% confidence.</p>

<p>So far I see no good evidence to suggest the true rate varies by base rarity (i.e. for 1 or 2 star mooks).</p>

<p>
	Note: with XL/L mooks having a ~20% total rate and maximum dummy links/analysis taking 5 total copies, I would generally not recommend raising medium or smaller units.
	On average, if you've pulled enough to fully link it, odds are decent you'll have pulled at least a large.
	On the other hand, waiting for an XL unit (especially for 2-star mooks) could easily take the better part of a year and may not be worth waiting for.
	Either way, keep in mind that 99% of coalition development can be done instantly. <!-- except RL primary skills, affection, and optional destroyer/nyto dragging. RL skills can be done whenever and the others aren't too important. -->
	If you don't have an immediate use for a unit, there's no need to invest in it.
</p>

<!-- I'll need more data to confirm this too, but evidence is mounting that XL rates could be > XS rates. Would be an odd hint of generosity in this system. -->
<h2 id="shiny">Shiny rate<sup><small><a href="#shiny">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>I do not currently have enough data to get a good estimate on the shiny rate.
As of last update, I have 9 shinies from 1092 total pulls (0.92% rate).
The true rate could plausibly be anywhere from 0.37-1.44% based on this.</p>
<!-- Most likely 1% at this point - 0.5 and 2% look unlikely, and 1% is a very nice round number. -->

<p>
	The chances of getting Basic/Advanced Training Keycodes are also not even.
	The true rate is commonly claimed to be 25%, but this seems exceptionally unlikely based on my data.
	Advanced keycodes are given out between 28.9-35.6% of the time, with 99% confidence.
	If I had to pick an exact number, I'd currently be most comfortable putting it around 33% (a 2:1 ratio).
</p>
<!--My personal results are shown above, which indicate a 25% advanced rate is very likely.</p> No more! -->
<!-- My results are a bit above that, although not enough to definitively prove the true rate is different - with 95% confidence, I'd estimate the true rate to be between 27.07% and 35.86% based on my results.</p> No more! -->

<p>SF skills take around 1.7:1 Basic:Advanced keycodes to train, so if you fully level all skills you'll build up a surplus of basic keycodes over time (as they're handed out at around a 2:1 ratio).
The advanced rate would need to be around 36-38% for the data types to be even.
The most efficient svarog bundle only including 1000 basic keycodes doesn't help either.</p>
