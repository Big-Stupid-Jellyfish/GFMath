<p><em>Disclaimer: numbers presented here are the result of my own data records.
They are only an estimation of the actual rates, and individual luck will vary.</em>

<h2 id="size">Coalition Unit size distribution<sup><small><a href="#size">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>SF unit sizes are not uniformly distributed, and instead follow a bell-shaped curve.
Below are the frequencies of each size from my pulls:</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Assuming equal odds for L/S and XL/XS, I would estimate the true odds to be something like:</p>
<center>
<table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Size</th>
    <th>Rate</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>60%</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Large/Small</td>
		<td>18%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Extra Large/Extra Small</td>
		<td>2%</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<h2 id="shiny">Shiny rate<sup><small><a href="#shiny">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>I do not currently have enough data for a good estimate on the shiny rate.
As of last update, I have 3 shinies from 259 total pulls (1.158% rate).
Due to the very low expected rate, quite a bit more data is needed to have any level of confidence on the true rate.</p>

<h2 id="decoding">Coalition Drill: Decoding Practice rates<sup><small><a href="#decoding">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<div class="figure">

<p>The chances of getting Basic/Advanced Training Keycodes are also not even.
My personal results are shown above, which indicate a 25% advanced rate is very likely.</p>

<p>Keep in mind - as there is no good reason to believe these rates vary by user or time, given enough simulations, the odds of having a different overall advanced keycode rate approach zero.
For example, assuming a true 25% advanced rate over 100 attempts (~2 months), less than 10% of people will have an advanced rate below 20%. After 500 attempts, less than 0.4% of people would.</p>

<p>SF skills take around 1.75:1 Basic:Advanced keycodes to train, so if you fully level all skills you'll build up a surplus of basic keycodes over time (as they're handed out at a 3:1 ratio).
The most efficient svarog bundle only including 1000 basic keycodes doesn't help either.</p>

<p>(My understanding is that 25% is the commonly accepted rate on foreign servers, although I'm not certain on its basis. If the odds have been datamined, please do let me know and I can simplify this section.)</p>
