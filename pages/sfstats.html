<p><em>Disclaimer: numbers presented here are the result of my own data records.
They are only an estimation of the actual rates, and individual luck will vary.
Statistics here are aggregated from several different accounts to improve accuracy, and so far there does not appear to be any per-account variation in rates outside of what normal luck would explain.
Over a sufficiently large period of time, your own results will not be far from these.</em>

<h2>Coalition Unit size distribution<sup><small><a href="#size">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<p>SF unit sizes are not uniformly distributed, and instead follow a sort of bell-shaped curve.
Below are the frequencies of each size from my pulls:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Qsjs3E.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<!-- <p>Assuming equal odds for L/S and XL/XS, I would estimate the true odds to be something like:</p> -->
<p>
	Interestingly, XL units appear to be more common than XS.
	The distribution of sizes is not symmetric.
	<!-- I have no evidence yet to suggest the same for Large and Small units. -->
	In table form, my current best estimates:
</p>
<center>
<table style="width:80%">
	<tr>
		<th>Size</th>
		<th>Estimated Rate</th>
		<th>Lower bound</th>
		<th>Upper bound</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Extra Small</td>
		<td>2%</td>
		<td>1.07%</td>
		<td>2.19%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Small</td>
		<td>18%</td>
		<td>16.36%</td>
		<td>19.82%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Medium</td>
		<td>60%</td>
		<td>57.65%</td>
		<td>62.07%</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Large</td>
		<td>16%</td>
		<td>14.69%</td>
		<td>18.01%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Extra Large</td>
		<td>4%</td>
		<td>3.32%</td>
		<td>5.12%</td>
	</tr>
	
	<!-- <tr>
		<td>Extra Large/Extra Small</td>
		<td>2.5%</td>
		<td>1.12%</td>
		<td>2.71%</td>
	</tr> -->
</table>
</center>
<p>
	Upper and lower bounds are listed with 95% confidence.
	My current suspicion is that sizes are binned into groups of [20% XL & L], [60% M], and [20% XS & S] with XL getting a bit more and XS getting a bit less of that 20%.
</p>

<p>So far I <a href="https://i.imgur.com/z0aBRCk.png">see no good evidence</a> to suggest the true rate varies by base rarity (i.e. for 1 or 2 star mooks).</p>

<!-- <p>
	The low frequency makes it difficult to be confident, but it currently looks plausible for XL units to be more common than XS ones.
	To put approximate round numbers to it, it may be something like ~4% XL and ~2% XS.
</p> -->
<p>
	Note: with XL/L mooks having a ~20% total rate and maximum dummy links/analysis taking 5 total copies, I would generally not recommend raising medium or smaller units.
	On average, if you've pulled enough to fully link it, odds are decent you'll have pulled at least a large.
	On the other hand, waiting for an XL unit (especially for 2-star mooks) could easily take the better part of a year and may not be worth waiting for.
	Either way, keep in mind that 99% of coalition development can be done instantly. <!-- except RL primary skills, affection, and optional destroyer/nyto dragging. RL skills can be done whenever and the others aren't too important. -->
	If you don't have an immediate use for a unit, there's no need to invest in it.
</p>

<!-- I'll need more data to confirm this too, but evidence is mounting that XL rates could be > XS rates. Would be an odd hint of generosity in this system. -->
<span class="anchor" id="shiny"></span>
<h2>Shiny rate<sup><small><a href="#shiny">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	"Shiny" units have a golden sparkle on their ID cards, and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kYM2z1D.png">an animated effect</a> on their frontmost chibi.
	This is a purely cosmetic effect, and has a small chance of coming with any unit you pull.
	Toggling the "Cognitive Infusion Button" to "Golden Infusion" in the Symmetric Infusion Drive lets you transfer shiny status to another unit.
</p>
<p>
	I do not currently have enough data to get a firm estimate on the shiny rate.
	As of last update, I have 13 shinies from 1894 total pulls (0.69% rate).
	The true rate could plausibly be anywhere from 0.37-1.10% based on this.
</p>

<p>
	One point of caution - the achievements for captures count failed attempts on 2* units and ringleaders, and don't count units acquired through the shop.
	Calculating your XL/XS/shiny rate based on those achievements will not give the right numbers.
</p>
<!-- Most likely 1% at this point - 0.5 and 2% look unlikely, and 1% is a very nice round number. -->

<span class="anchor" id="decoding"></span>
<h2>Coalition Drill: Decoding Practice rates<sup><small><a href="#decoding">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

<div class="figure">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/noPluQq.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>
	The chances of getting Basic/Advanced Training Keycodes are also not even.
	The true rate is commonly claimed to be 25%, but this seems exceptionally unlikely based on my data.
	Advanced keycodes are given out between 28.9-33.5% of the time, with 95% confidence.
	If I had to pick an exact number, I'd currently be most comfortable putting it at 30% (a 2.33:1 ratio).
</p>
<!--My personal results are shown above, which indicate a 25% advanced rate is very likely.</p> No more! -->
<!-- My results are a bit above that, although not enough to definitively prove the true rate is different - with 95% confidence, I'd estimate the true rate to be between 27.07% and 35.86% based on my results.</p> No more! -->

<p>SF skills take around 1.7:1 Basic:Advanced keycodes to train, so if you fully level all skills you'll build up a surplus of basic keycodes over time.
The advanced rate would need to be around 36-38% for the data types to be even.
The most efficient svarog bundle only including 1000 basic keycodes doesn't help either.</p>

<p>
	For more exact numbers:
</p>
<center>
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<th>Base rarity</th>
<th>Total basic needed</th>
<th>Total advanced needed</th>
<th>Ratio</th>
<th>Percent advanced</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1-star</td>
<td>1000</td>
<td>600</td>
<td>1.67:1</td>
<td>37.5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2-star</td>
<td>2000</td>
<td>1200</td>
<td>1.67:1</td>
<td>37.5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3-star (Ringleader)</td>
<td>7200</td>
<td>4200</td>
<td>1.71:1</td>
<td>36.8%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
	Keep in mind that, over a multi-month period, the range of normal luck will not stray far from these rate estimates.
	No one has an average long-term advanced keycode rate of 50%, for example.
	It is virtually impossible to have a surplus of advanced keycodes, unless you spend gems for more in packages or don't plan to level any significant amount of SF.
