<h1>Anna Analysis</h1>
</header>
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2022-April-16</em></center>
<p>
	<em>This is part of a series covering the VA-11 Hall-A dolls. <a href="valhalla">You can go back to the overview here</a>.</em>
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><strong>Nano Ghost</strong>. Cost: 1 Fairy Command</p>
	<p>
		In the next battle, T-Dolls in the front column gain 30% evasion but lose 20% damage while other T-Dolls gain 20% damage but lose 30% evasion for 20 seconds.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Aura: 25% FP, 30% ACC, 65% EVA, 8% Armor.
</p>
<p>
	Anna is usually considered as a variant Warrior fairy who trades some ROF for more evasion.
	This is a reasonable comparison - both of their auras are rather weak, and their skill directly boosts DPS back to more normal levels.
</p>
<p>
	With skills activated, Anna adds 50% FP in total and 114.5% EVA in the first 20 seconds (plus 30% ACC).
	Warrior offers a 65% net DPS increase split across FP/ROF, 80% ACC, and just 40% EVA.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, Anna has to compete with more fairies than just Warrior.
	Artillery gives 55% FP and 56% EVA, at no fairy command cost.
	Parachute goes up to a 90% DPS boost, and Taunt/Twin/Shield/Beach have incredibly useful defensive skills.
</p>
<p>
	For more comparisons with other fairies, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NqGWi8WF-sh-Eb6x-dCi3KvkYHRIkG5WCch2tuQahgc/edit?usp=sharing">see this spreadsheet</a>.

<h2>Historical Uses<sup><small><a href="#history">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Anna was relatively popular in Singularity ranking to kill M16, although a number of other 5-star fairies (Warrior, Command to start) also worked.
	</li>
</ul>
<span class="anchor" id="conclusion"></span>
<h2>Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Anna offers decent DPS and lots of EVA, but needs fairy commands to perform.
	And at that point, several other fairies give you more bang for your buck.
</p>
<p>
	Event fairies only need 550 development XP to raise to 5 stars, so she's a reasonable investment to get your first high-rarity fairy - especially if you have prototypes from a previous event.
	But in that case, you should also have Desert which will be more useful in the future.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Optional.</strong>

<h2>Minor Notes<sup><small><a href="#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<li>
	Sei is one of the two farmable dolls from this collab, so you can theoretically farm however many time allows.
	Her SPEQ is not infinitely farmable, but as an improved X-Exo (+34 EVA, no FP penalty) it's not even remotely important.
	Still, she's not worth duping.
