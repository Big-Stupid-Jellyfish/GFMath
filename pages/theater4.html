				<h1>Theater 4</h1>
				<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | 2021-April-19</em></center>

        <p>A nice feature of client 2.07 is the new Target Saving system.
        You can save any enemy group to it, and test all sorts of teams at no cost.
        I've recorded a number of test fights against all the enemies in the hardest sections of the upcoming Theater.</p>

        <p>Each demonstration is done independently from the others.
        When actually building teams for your theater attempt, you'll need to work out a set of teams that doesn't rely on duplicates of dolls/fairies and won't take too much damage to clear.</p>

        <p>Most of the teams shown are far from optimal.
        You can almost certainly do better than a 1:1 copy of them, which will lower kiting requirements and reduce damage taken.
        For some more discussion on teambuilding, I recommend checking out <a href="https://gamepress.gg/girlsfrontline/theater-teambuilding-guide">this guide</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU8EQs89zdxZ3Jel2NDuDi3HgdphrmXJY">Video playlist here.</a>
        In my quest to find lower-spec teams that can clear each node, some of the fights result in a bit more damage than you may want on a normal run.
        If you've been keeping up with equipment/fairy crafts, it shouldn't be hard to have something better.
        A typical selfbuffing rifle (SVD, WA2000, M14, Lee Enfield, G28, and so on) is generally preferable to Springfield - I'm only using Springfield due to her accessibility as an IOP Career Quest reward.</p>

        <h2 id="notes">Other Notes<sup><small><a href="theater4.html#notes">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

        <p>Type88 mod, Carcano M91/38, and M200(/SSG3000) are all valuable dolls to have in this Theater.
        I strongly recommend raising and using them.
        Type88 requires her neural upgrade to be usable but is still reasonably viable at mod2 without a highly leveled Skill 2.</p>

        <p>Shield HGs (HS2000 and P22 to an extent) can make certain fights much easier. These are all event dolls so accessibility is limited, but I recommend raising them if you have them/farming them if available in PL.</p>

        <p>Taunt and Twin fairies are very useful for mitigating damage.
        Having them ready at SL10 can make some fights almost free.</p>

        <p>ARSMG echelons see limited use in this Theater. You'll want at least one, but it's not a priority to optimize and won't face many hard fights.</p>

        <p>If you <em>do</em> have a strong armory, developed fairies, and don't want to think too hard - KSVK mod, NTW mod, M1895 mod, Calico mod, P22, and a 5* Taunt can kill everything in Core 8 except the Pyxis taking little to no damage.
        There are other viable combinations, but I found that team to work very nicely.</p>

        <h2 id="hoc">HOCs<sup><small><a href="theater4.html#hoc">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>

        <p>The HOCs used in these videos. Chips are mostly unenhanced, +5 or so at most.
        The most important thing is to get the HOCs you plan on using to level 60, and equipping some decent (enhanced) 5* chips.
        Certain skills will also help, but their value varies.
        BGM/2B14's first skills are probably the most important for dealing with force shields/enemy crowds.</p>

        <h3>How?</h3>

        While (at the time of recording/writing) Theater 4 isn't here yet, GFAlarm lets you load any enemies you have the <a href="https://pengupengupengu.github.io/gflmaps/#campaign=6005&mission=548">team ID of</a> into the system.
