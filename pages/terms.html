				<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
				<!-- initial: 2021-January-14 -->
				<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | Last updated 2021-March-04</em></center>

        <p>There are a lot of specific terms used within the community and in my writings.
				Here's a list of the more important ones I can think of:</p>

				<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
<thead><tr><th title="Field #1">Term</th>
<th title="Field #2">Definition</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>FP</td>
<td>Firepower, also known as damage/dmg (stat)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ROF</td>
<td>Rate of fire (stat)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Acc</td>
<td>Accuracy (stat)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Eva</td>
<td>Evasion (stat)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Selfbuff[er]</td>
<td>A doll skill that primarily boosts one or more of their attributes, usually FP or ROF</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Surehit</td>
<td>Skill attacks that are guaranteed to hit (examples: M200, Grape, Mosin)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AOE</td>
<td>Area of effect - attacks that hit multiple enemies. Primarily from grenades/molotovs or special skills like Hanyang's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Position 1..9</td>
<td>Formation positions of your dolls, as on a keyboard numpad where 1 is the bottom left corner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SL</td>
<td>Skill level</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CD</td>
<td>Cooldown - often with respect to skills, the time in seconds before it's usable again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ICD</td>
<td>Initial cooldown - the time in seconds before a skill can first be activated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proc</td>
<td>Refers to the activation/triggering of a chance-based ability or skill. For example, you could say Python's active gets up to a 100% proc chance at SL10, versus only a 40% chance to trigger at SL1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DPS</td>
<td>Damage per second</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AP</td>
<td>Armor piercing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DJ or Double Jupiter</td>
<td>A team made of M4, a strong rifle, and 3 HG. M4 skill is manually activated, HG skills activate, and you retreat 2. Often used in ranking maps for killing particularly tough groups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kiting</td>
<td>The practice of moving your dolls in battle to manipulate enemy attacks/skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maintank</td>
<td>SMG that sits on position 5 of a typical ARSMG formation. Takes most of the shots and generally has a defensive skill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Offtank</td>
<td>SMG that sits on positions 2 or 8 of a typical ARSMG formation. Generally has an offensive skill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HP</td>
<td>Hit points (health)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VFL</td>
<td>(Gold) critical rate scope - +48% at maximum enhancement and calibration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>EOT</td>
<td>(Gold) Damage/accuracy scope - +14 acc, +6 FP, -4 ROF</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ITI</td>
<td>(Gold) Accuracy scope - +30 acc, -1 ROF</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HP</td>
<td>Hollow point (equipment). Not to be confused with hitpoints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gunboat</td>
<td>Formation of 2-4 MG and 1-3 HG designed to burst down certain dangerous enemies before they get to attack. Commonly used against Typhons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exodia</td>
<td>Formation centered around buffing one unit. Usually used for cheap farming. Derives from <a href="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/d/dc/ExodiatheForbiddenOne-LDK2-EN-C-1E.png">a certain children's card game.</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CR</td>

<td>Special combat report (for HOCs)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HOC</td>

<td>1/30th of a second, the smallest time increment recognizable in combat. 15f = 1/2 second, for example.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>X/Y uptime</td>
<td>A skill with duration <em>X</em> seconds and cooldown <em>Y</em> seconds. Fractions are not reduced: 5/8 uptime is different from 10/16. This doesn't relate to ICD.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dupe</td>
<td>A duplicate doll/fairy, to be raised and used in combat (not for dummy linking). Mostly relevant for ranking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Farming</td>
<td>Repeatedly playing [a part of] a map to gain cores, get chances at limited drops, or get event currency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reset</td>
<td>Also known as savescumming. If you're not happy with how a fight is going, close the app and restart before the combat completes/fails and you get to try again from the start. Almost essential for challenging maps & rankings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big 4</td>
<td>Some collection of widely-used MGs. In the past, it referred to PKP/PK/M2HB/MG5 as they were the best for 1st-volley DPS. Kord, M1895 CB, and RPK-16 are newer candidates. Most good MGs nowadays do different things so this isn't a very useful way to think of them.</td>
</tr>
<td>0-2, 5-4E, 4-1N, etc</td>
<td>Shorthand for different maps. For example: 3-2 is Chapter 3, map 2. Suffix "E" means "Emergency," and "N" is "Night." Event maps may be written with a prefix E (e.g. DD E3-4 for the final map in Deep Dive).</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Dual Randomness (story event)</td>
</tr>

				<p>Also, plenty of dolls have names that are a pain to type out and thus have gained some nicknames.
				The ones I'm most likely to use are:</p>

				<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
				<thead><tr><th title="Field #1">Doll (in-game name)</th>
				<th title="Field #2">Nickname</th>
				</tr></thead>
				<tbody>
				<tr>
				<td>Carcano M1891</td>
				<td>Strawberry, Pink</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Carcano M91/38</td>
				<td>Grape, Purple</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Desert Eagle</td>
				<td>Deagle</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Five-Seven</td>
				<td>5-7</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Kar98k</td>

				<tr>
				<td>Mosin-Nagant</td>
				<td>Mosin</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>MP-446</td>
				<td>Viking</td>

				<tr>

				</tr>

				<td>ST AR-15</td>
				<td>STAR, AR-15</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Type88</td>
				<td>Hanyang</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>WA2000</td>
				<td>Wa, WA2k (generally, X000 numbers may be shortened like this)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Zas M21</td>
				<td>Zas. Despite the similarity, this never means Zas M76.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Parachute fairy</td>
				<td>Para</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Illumination fairy</td>
				<td>Illu</td>
				</tr>
				</tbody></table>

				<p>Generically, prefixes like Gr, Am, Fr, and Gd may be omitted (Gr G41 = G41, for example).
				Same with suffix numbers when there are no overlaps (SPAS-12 = SPAS, USAS-12 = USAS, for example).</p>

				<p>A few others I'm less likely to use (but others will):</p>

				<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
				<thead><tr><th title="Field #1">Doll (in-game name)</th>
				<th title="Field #2">Nickname</th>
				</tr></thead>
				<tbody>
				<tr>
				<td>Five-Seven</td>
				<td>Hoxy</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>FNC</td>
				<td>Choco</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>M200</td>
				<td>Potato</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>M82A1</td>
				<td>Inori (not to be confused with the newer 4* AR who also has pink hair, FI M82)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>OTs-12</td>
				<td>Tiss</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Vector</td>
				<td>Vivi</td>
				</tr>
				</tbody></table>

				<p>Finally, a few enemies have annoying names to type. Some nicknames:</p>

				<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
				<thead><tr><th title="Field #1">Enemy (in-game/index name)</th>
				<th title="Field #2">Nickname</th>
				</tr></thead>
				<tbody><tr>
				<td><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/ivptnz/minotaurus_preview/">Minotaurus</a></td>
				<td>Tesla trooper</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/itt06a/centaurus_preview/">Centaurus</a></td>
				<td>Archer</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/iv2bba/orthrus_preview/">Orthrus</a></td>
				<td>Dog, KCCO dog</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/iwfysy/patroller_review/">Patroller</a></td>
				<td>Strider</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/girlsfrontline/comments/iwsgr3/gladiator_preview/">Gladiator</a></td>
				<td>Roarer</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Doppelsöldner</td>
				<td>Gundam, Doppel</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Goliath</td>
				<td>Black bean, golyat.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Red Self-Explosion Enemy</td>
				<td>Red bean, red goliath, goliath+, golyat plus. Why the index calls it this remains a mystery.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Aegis_GA</td>
				<td>KCCO Aegis or Aegis. Not to be confused with the typical SF Aegis.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>BOSS Zombie</td>
				<td>Smasher</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>RecceCentre</td>
				<td>Factory</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Argonauts - Carina/Vela/Puppis</td>
				<td>Gustav (top/middle/bottom depending on map location)</td>
				</tr>
				</tbody></table>

				<p>Dinergates (unarmored) and Tarantulas (armored) are also sometimes called dogs/doggos, though I try to avoid this to reduce confusion between them and with Orthrus. Uhlans and Typhons are often called tanks, but again I prefer to use their specific names.</p>
