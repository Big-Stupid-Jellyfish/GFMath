<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<!-- initial: 2021-January-14 -->
<center><em>By BigStupidJellyfish | Last updated 2021-December-08</em></center>

<p>There are a lot of specific terms used within the community and in my writings.
Here's a list of the more important ones I can think of:</p>

<p>Game stats/features/events:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">

<p>Gameplay-related terms:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
<thead><tr><th title="Term">Term</th>
<th title="Definition">Definition</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>AOE</td>
<td>Area of effect - attacks that hit multiple enemies. Primarily from grenades/molotovs or special skills like Hanyang's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Big 4</td>
<td>Some collection of widely-used MGs. In the past, it referred to PKP/PK/M2HB/MG5 as they were the best for 1st-volley DPS. Kord, M1895 CB, and RPK-16 are newer candidates. Most good MGs nowadays do different things so this isn't a very useful way to think of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DJ or Double Jupiter</td>
<td>A team made of M4, a strong rifle, and 3 HG. M4 skill is manually activated, HG skills activate, and you retreat 2. Often used in ranking maps for killing particularly tough groups.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DPS</td>
<td>Damage per second</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dummy</td>
<td>An echelon with only one unsupplied doll, for action point/swap purposes only. Useful for S-ranking/silvering maps if you can deploy multiple echelons but don't need to fight with all of them. A 1-linked HG is recommended so it gives vision on night maps. In other contexts, it may refer to a doll's dummy links.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dupe</td>
<td>A duplicate doll/fairy, to be raised and used in combat (not for dummy linking). Mostly relevant for ranking. See also: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NVrDqW2.png">a visual explanation</a> by Raphael15.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exodia</td>
<td>Formation centered around buffing one unit. Usually used for cheap farming. Comes from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QAiB3gM.png">a certain children's card game.</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Farming</td>
<td>Repeatedly playing [a part of] a map to gain cores, get chances at limited drops, or get event currency.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Frame (f)</td>
<td>1/30th of a second, the smallest time increment recognizable in combat. ROF is converted into a frame delay by taking floor(1500/ROF stat). Example: G41 has 77 ROF. 1500/77=19.48, floor(19.48)=19 frames or 30/19=1.579 attacks/second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gunboat</td>
<td>Formation of 2-4 MG and 1-3 HG designed to burst down certain dangerous enemies before they get to attack. Commonly used against Typhons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HEC</td>
<td>Heavy equipment craft/construction. Do these to get fairies, do <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/453784246515925003/837028758082551878/unknown.png">4-16/day for speedy development</a> (table by Mis).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Isomer scoring</td>
<td>A collection of scoring mechanics introduced with Isomer on foreign servers. Largely to do with receiving points at the end of a run for a number of controlled nodes - 10k for a command post, 500 for regular nodes, 2k for helipads, and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kiting</td>
<td>The practice of moving your dolls in battle to manipulate enemy attacks/skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maintank</td>
<td>SMG that sits on position 5 of a typical ARSMG formation. Takes most of the shots and generally has a defensive skill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Offtank</td>
<td>SMG that sits on positions 2 or 8 of a typical ARSMG formation, usually with a grenade/molotov/damage buff skill. Stands for either "offensive" tank (SMGs with offensive skill) or "off-side" tank (SMGs positioned next to main tank, could include non-offensive or support skills), depending on who you ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Position 1..9</td>
<td>Formation positions of your dolls, as on a keyboard numpad where 1 is the bottom left corner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proc</td>
<td>Refers to the activation/triggering of a chance-based ability or skill. For example, you could say Python's active gets up to a 100% proc chance at SL10, versus only a 40% chance to trigger at SL1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reset</td>
<td>Also known as savescumming. If you're not happy with how a fight is going, close the app and restart before the combat completes/fails and you get to try again from the start. Almost essential for challenging maps & rankings. Previously could be used to change fairy talent proc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Selfbuff[er]</td>
<td>A doll with a skill that primarily boosts one or more of their attributes, usually FP or ROF. Examples: ST AR-15, G41, WA2000, M14.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Strong fairy</td>
<td>Usually a high-rarity (4 or 5-star) fairy with a strong DPS-oriented aura. Command/Artillery/Parachute are typical, often used in the context of farming routes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Surehit</td>
<td>Skill attacks that are guaranteed to hit. Examples: M200, Carcano M91/38, Mosin-Nagant, AS Val mod.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SVAROG</td>
<td>Aid commission - the SF capture item that grabs one thing from the entire pool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wiggle/Retarget</td>
<td>By giving a DPS doll a movement command (move to some square) and immediately telling them to move back, they'll wiggle slightly in place and start shooting a new target. Useful against Recce Centres (with ARSMG) and dangerous backlines that don't start in range (with RFHG).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>X/Y uptime</td>
<td>A skill with duration <em>X</em> seconds and cooldown <em>Y</em> seconds. Fractions are not reduced: 5/8 uptime is different from 10/16. This doesn't include ICD.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Also, plenty of dolls have names that are a pain to type out and thus have gained some nicknames.
Here are some of the more common ones:</p>

<p>Generically, prefixes like Gr, Am, Fr, and Gd may be omitted (Gr G41 = G41, for example).
Same with suffix numbers when there are no overlaps (SPAS-12 = SPAS, USAS-12 = USAS, for example).</p>

<!-- <p>A few others I'm less likely to use (but others will):</p>

<p>
	These should be pretty rare and I don't recommend their usage, but there are some internal names the game uses.
	For reference, here are the ones that stuck out to me:

<p>Finally, a few enemies have annoying names to type. Some nicknames:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">

</tbody></table>

<p>
	Dinergates (unarmored) and Tarantulas (armored) are also sometimes called dogs/doggos, though I try to avoid this to reduce confusion between them and with Orthrus.
	Uhlans and Typhons are often called tanks, but again I prefer to use their specific names.
	Enemy names can be found in-game by going to Index > Enemy units.
	Keep in mind that Manticores (large brown SF machine walkers) are very different enemies than Hydras (large green KCCO machine walkers).
