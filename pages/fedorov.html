<p>
	Okay, we needed to add in a bit of text for this to make sense (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz9jN-ntYb8">test here showing ROF & FP stacking</a>).
	Now that that's settled, we have a pretty unique AR here.
	She's clearly geared towards long fights, building up to a 100% uptime 60% FP/60% ROF/60% ACC buff after 20-25 seconds - far beyond the 4-star "standard" of ~65% more DPS with ~62.5% uptime.
</p>
<p>
	There are two big things I'd like to figure out:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>How long does it take for Fedorov to catch up to or exceed typical ARs in total damage?</li>
	<li>How big of a problem is the ROF selfbuff, and how does that interact with chips?</li>
</ol>
<p>
	As usual, we can turn to our "relative cumulative damage" chart style.
	The one good non-crit fairy (Shield) is focused on short fights, so I'll assume a high crit aura for all of these.
	Numbers may change a little bit if using something like Taunt/Desert, but it's not a huge deal.
	I'm also assuming no buffs are coming in mid-battle.
	Fervor or a buffing HG will adjust her lines ever so slightly left, but it's once again minor.
	The buffs are only on the <em>remaining</em> cooldown time of that skill cycle, and don't stack.
</p>
<p>
	First, with just a para fairy:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/fedorov/fedorov-para.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<ul>
	<li>Fedorov clearly prefers a chip. Even after she reaches max stacks at 25 seconds, it has a clear advantage over an exo.</li>
	<li>Despite the 0-second ICD, 10-20% FP is not enough to make Fedorov a fast-acting AR. She starts to be worth considering if targeting fights 35 seconds or longer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	M4A1 is a good AR, and her tiles push us a little more towards crits:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/fedorov/fedorov-para-m4.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<ul>
	<li>We still like chips, but now you're looking at 50s+ for Fedorov to be worth consideration. Adding crit rate hurts her when compared to SPEQ ARs that get to keep their 150% crit damage base (but not, of course, compared to other standard chipped ARs).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	There's also RO635, and her 15% ROF tiles cause chips to overcap a bit more:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/fedorov/fedorov-para-ro.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	We see a similar "viability crossover" to the first case at ~35s, but this time a VFL+exo/empty slot just barely looks to catch up 60 seconds in.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, let's combine RO635 and M4:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/fedorov/fedorov-para-ro-m4.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	In this case, Fedorov's "viability crossover" is about aligned with her switch to preferring no chip - both around 40 seconds in.
</p>

<p>
	We can also quick check two quick cases with a non-crit damage fairy and confirm she prefers chips more in those cases:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/fedorov/fedorov-arty.png" width="49%"/>
	<img src="images/fedorov/fedorov-arty-ro-m4.png" width="49%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	Fedorov gains a bit of ground relative to the other ARs, but this isn't territory you really want to be in either way.
</p>
<p>
	And if you're looking <em>really</em> long-term, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8o7ZNnr">here's all the same para charts</a> but going up to 10,000 seconds in semilog plots.
	Note that, in the first two cases, chips <em>always</em> maintain a lead. There's no hidden 200-second crossover.
	Interestingly, in the first case (just para), Fedorov does manage to barely out-scale STAR past ~100 seconds.
</p>

<p>
	If you're using Fedorov, you're probably in a long battle and would really like a fairy with Fervor.
	As a bonus, this triggers three times to reduce her cooldown, which sounds like it would make her better.
	Let's run the numbers again using the conditions of <a href="images/fedorov/fedorov-para.png">the first chart</a>, resulting in:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9gFUKUE.png" width="100%"/>
</div><em></em></center>
<p>
	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/PQSJZUT.png">Differences highlighted here</a>, if it's too close to tell.
	She gets to max stacks ~1.5 seconds faster.
	Fervor also places a little more emphasis on later DPS, but again, this won't fundamentally change how she does.
</p>
<span class="anchor" id="conclusion"></span>
<h2>Conclusion<sup><small><a href="#conclusion">&#35;</a></small></sup></h2>
<p>
	Within the realm of mortal ARs (i.e., those not named AR-15/G11/416/...), Fedorov has potential use in boss-style fights that last ~40 seconds or more.
	In such scenarios, she prefers to use a chip unless:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>You have a significant crit damage aura, and:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You have ROF tiles on her, and are looking at a 60s+ long fight, or:</li>
		<li>You have ROF & crit rate tiles on her</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	If you don't have strong crit-oriented fairies, stick to an EOT/chip.
	In short or medium-length encounters, use any normal selfbuffer AR instead.
</p>
<p>
	Her tiles rather uniquely buff both HGs & SMGs. This doesn't change her usage.
</p>
<p>
	Regardless, there's little need for ARs, we have some truly busted mods to compete for that corner, and there aren't many boss fights that long which also ask for an ARSMG.
	She has some interesting ideas, but you do not need to raise Fedorov.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't actually matter, but as a funny bonus, Fedorov scales slightly worse with walk time - due to her 0s ICD, her skill doesn't count down any faster during the run-up.
</p>

<p>
	Standard disclaimer: teams should be built as needed according to the circumstances of specific maps and enemies.
	Do not blindly copy-and-paste teams.
	With that in mind, here are some not-entirely-awful ideas to illustrate where Fedorov can be used.
