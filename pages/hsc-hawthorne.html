		Heroscape is a tabletop war game released in 2004 and discontinued in 2008. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroscape">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.heroscapers.com/community/blog.php?u=2">fan site</a>.
		Attack dice show a skull 50% of the time. Defense dice show a shield 33% of the time. Each excess skull rolled counts as one wound.
		Disclaimer: I'm not particularly aware of any existing theory/math for this game.
		Topics like this may have been covered in the past.
		This is just something I got interested in doing for myself, in my own style.

		If Sir Hawthorne rolls at least 2 skulls with his Blind Rage Special Attack, Sir Hawthorne may attack again with his Blind Rage Special Attack.
		Sir Hawthorne may continue attacking with his Blind Rage Special Attack until he rolls fewer than 2 skulls.

	Compared to his basic attack with 4 dice, it's not immediately apparent which attack to go with.
	You have a 50% chance of getting <em>at least</em> one extra attack in, but each one is weaker.
	(And while there's a fair bit of variance, this works out to an average of two attacks per turn.)
	Simulation time:

</div></center>
<p>
	Blind Rage is effectively always better than his basic attack.
	If he has height, use regular attacks against heroes with 3 or more defense.
	If you have two extra attack dice, always use his normal attack against heroes (unless of course some other ability interacts unfavorably with it).
</p>
<p>
	Against squads, there's no benefit to overkill. As for how much this helps Blind Rage:
</p>
<center><div class="figure">
	<img src="images/hsc-hawthorne/hawthorne-squad.png" width="100%"/>
</div></center>
<p>
	This makes his Blind Rage much stronger, and now +1 die is only enough against 6+ defense enemies.
	Even +2 dice only make his regular attack worthwhile for 5+ defense.
